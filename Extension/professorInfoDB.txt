"Raymond Duda","1.9","57","3.1","N/A","I took this as an online class, the professor often came off as extremely rude with his comments. The syllabus wasn't provided until several weeks in, then was constantly changed due to his mistakes. His instructions were very confusing. Papers were not returned in a timely manner to reflect and avoid making similar mistakes on the next paper."
"Roberto Kampfner","2.6","28","2.6","N/A","Kampfner is a really nice guy. Though he forgot about our meeting, he agreed to review one of my labs for more points. That said, he is an absolutely awful professor. Reads from PowerPoints, which are nothing more than book material, in his thick accent. Doesn't break down the (sometimes insane) material very well. Nice guy, horrible prof."
"Sandra Wray-McAfee","1.5","84","4.3","N/A","Wow, on 5/18/2011 that is her for sure!  Praising Dr. Cohen, asking condescending questions, praising herself, and she was quite fond of the phrase 'peaches and cream'.  Talk about lame considering she had been retired by then.  I had her in 2001, she was irritating but I've had worse.  I'll call her okay but annoying and kind of rude."
"Marjorie Lynn","2.3","74","3.4","N/A","Mrs. Lynn is one of the best professors I've had. Most students due poorly (C-B) range, but it's because they're grossly incompetent. There's only so much a professor can do to help and Mrs. Lynn does it all. I recommend taking her if you're a good writer. Don't  take her if you are expecting an easy A. You have to write many essays and participate"
"Ralph Kolinski","3.6","21","4.4","N/A","Do not miss class.  The material for the exams come from his lectures. He will go over every concept multiple times.   Explain it on the exam the way he explained it in class and you will do fine. I wouldn't say the book was useless, but you don't need it.  You will either be amused or offended by the commentary.  Probably both at some point."
"Andrew Strowe","3.5","99","3.3","N/A","great professor, teaches very well and tests are not hard if you attend lecture, hard to understand because speaks very soft and quiet"
"Kathleen Wider","3.7","56","3.7","N/A","So I came into this class thinking it would be as easy as my previous class in high school... man, I was dead wrong. She grades you so hard and without any explanation, lectures are long and her voice makes you want to bring a pillow to class and sleep until the last 20mins of class when she actually starts to teach... oh, expect to be up late."
"Jane Sheldon","4.8","154","2.8","89%","Awesome sauce!"
"Pk Mallick","3.4","13","3.4","40%","He speaks quietly. His lectures go on and on, which made me doze almost every day. The slides he has are very helpful and he points out what sections to focus on. He is very helpful during office hours. There were pop quizzes in class, which if you pay attention, are easy to ace. Overall the class and teacher weren't as bad as I had heard."
"Henry Povolny","3.2","56","4","N/A","the guy below just showed his true colors on the exam and he sucks. Prof Povolny is a great prof. He's not going to tell jokes all class and entertain you but you will learn if you use the brain in your head."
"Linda Rapp","3","48","3.8","N/A","HORRIBLE. One word to sum it up, Horrible. Two words? Ridiculously horrible.  She does not help you as a student as well as grades very hard. I went from my 101 class with a 97% to her class and ended with a 75%. I took Spanish before, so i know the content but she is just very hard and unbearable. Please stay away if you can! Wish i would have"
"Debra Fletcher","3.9","107","2.2","100%","great teacher!!"
"Richard Adler","2.8","221","4.2","25%","He is one of the least personable professors I have ever met, and he made an introductory level biology class unnecessarily hard. Ugh."
"Mark Decamp","3.7","103","3","N/A","more of a clown rather than a teacher. majority of students don't attend lecture, and as a result, help the ones that do show up. class is based on a bell curve, so he has to give out A's, to a certain amount of students, regardless of how dumb they are. This doesn't make those kids smarter than the ones that get a B or a C. book is worthless"
"Elias Baumgarten","3.2","91","3.3","50%","Worst Professor don't recommend. His teaching skills are poor, he rambles on and on in class, asks a question and keeps talking, giving no one a chance to speak and wonders why no one is participating. Never answers questions students have, his exams are extremely hard because of they way he words the exam, making it difficult to understand."
"Randy Woodland","3.1","22","2","100%","prof. Woodland is amazing, for engineering students he understand we are taking hard and heavy math/science classes. so he doesnt expect you to go crazy on the class"
"Sid Bolkosky","3.7","47","3.5","N/A","Amazing teacher."
"Robert Simpson","4.3","3","3.7","N/A","he a really tough grader if your looking for a B or better go look somewhere else class average was a D+"
"David Schroat","4","17","1.8","N/A","Professor Schroat is the best professor on campus. Extremely sweet, kind, and understanding. I went to class maybe once every 2 weeks. Tests are all multiple choicememorization. An easy A every time."
"Bruce Elenbogen","3.2","132","4","74%","Hands down my favorite teacher in all of my 150 credits"
"Paul Lin","4.1","58","2.3","N/A","Dr. Lin is a great prof. He has an accent that would prevent him from clearly explaining the concept but he tries hard to help you understand and get a high grade. He drop the lowest test, gives group work for Extra credit, few quizzes. Do the home work, attend class and you will get a good grade. He is funny and kind. I highly recommend him!"
"Raymond Kettel","4.6","25","1.9","N/A","Dr. Kettel is a very nice man but his class is absolutely pointless.  He is just one of many who has an attendance policy.  My belief is that attendance policies are only used when the class is not worth attending!  I was frustrated and bored in the class - it could have been so much more."
"Grace Stewart","2.5","55","3.4","N/A","Every assignment is unclear and most of the papers were extremely personal.  Refuses to assign alternate assignments.  Very uncooperative and can be rude."
"Anita Handelman","1.6","48","3.4","N/A","She never returned papers or posted grades, so I had nobody in class had any idea how they were doing. Her lectures went off on tangents about the history of the English language and had nothing to do with the class. Stay away from this one."
"Chia-Hao Chang","2.8","11","2.2","N/A","His lectures were most boring I spent most of the time in class making study guides from his powerpoints or doing hw for other classes. As long as you turn in assignments on time and your exams are NOT way below average, you should get at least a B."
"Jeffrey Stern","4.3","111","3.1","100%","He was my prof in the late seventies. Was so entertaining that I remember more from his classes than any other in my undergraduate studies. Brilliant."
"Shelley Perlove","3.6","48","3.4","100%","Fine class - she gets really off topic. Not really a history of photography class but more history of whatever the f*** she wants to talk about."
"Ronald Stockton","3.4","122","3.6","67%","Which other class can quote The Godfather, have students who are ex Special Forces, and has stories from politicians around the world? Had his class 20+ years ago and still use his lectures and stories in day-to-day discussions.

Ask him about the Uganda Scheme."
"Angela Krebs","3.3","32","3.5","100%","Great Professor! Only issue was that there was a lot of homework and it was difficult to keep up with.She was very effective in her teaching and I could tell she cared, the excessive homework was to just further our understanding, however I would not recommend you take this class if you sign up for other work intensive courses in the same semester."
"John Miller","3.4","69","2.8","12%","Not great at teaching. His lectures are just him messing around in LTspice trying to get stuff to work. Projects are fairly easy but you have to build and demo the circuits you design. You don't learn anything in his lectures, just look over past exams and show up the class before the exam when he reviews the material."
"Louis Tsui","3","48","3.4","N/A","I really enjoyed professor Tsui.  I struggled throughout the class, but the projects really helped me grasp the information. I was able to truly grasp more advanced concepts in coding through his teaching method. He taught differently than most teachers because he went at a rate that the class learned. He always helped during office hours too."
"Jacqueline Vansant","2.5","16","4.6","0%","Vansant is extremely nice, however she is a very demanding teacher. Expects a lot from her students for an entry level German class. It is obvious she cares about the subject, I just wish she would understand a lot of us are learning an language for the first time."
"Ghassan Kridli","3.8","57","2.8","70%","I took 421 with him and was a nightmare . Dr Kridli is quite demanding with his lecture and exams. Lotsssss of homework, luckily it was a normal semester . I cant imagine that class in 7 weeks. I would not take it with him again. AVOID ."
"Bonnie Beyer","2.3","14","3.2","0%","Dr. Beyer loves her job, but she doesn't put herself in others' shoes. You might need something from her, and she will treat you like a suspect to the point where you won't get what you really need from her, such as a letter of recommendation."
"Lars Bjorn","3.6","34","2.7","N/A","The lectures are long and uninteresting. He sometimes goes off on a tangent, which makes it hard to take notes. Don't rely on the lecture, read the book! There is only 1 paper and 1 exam (essay) for the entire course, so there is little room for error. He gave us a review sheet for the exam but then the exam didn't cover any of the same material."
"Joseph Gaughan","3.5","90","1.7","75%","You have to pay attention and take knows. Make sure you read the chapters before the class, so you can understand. Hes very monotone, but he is very knowledgeable and passionate about anthropology."
"Martha Adler","4.3","11","2.2","N/A","Unbelievable!! I learned SO MUCH from Dr. Adler that I have been able to take with me into my own classroom.  She is always available either face-to-face or via email.  HIGHLY recommended both as a professor and as an advisor.  Her expectations are clear and the workload is manageable.  She's a great resource, she's very knowledgeable."
"Richard Moyer","4.2","21","2.9","N/A","He is a nice teacher and he knows what is he talking about. He is a picky grader tho, but very helpful when you ask for his help. The assignment in this class were overwhelming but doable. I would take another class with him. Recommended"
"James Brown","4.9","51","1.3","N/A","Probably the best professor I have ever had.  This guy is an impeccable professor, down to earth, humble, and nice to his students.  He is always willing to help and doesn't fluff people off.  Yes it is an easy A (if all you're looking for is an easy A), but it's up to you whether or not you want to learn something.  Too bad he retired..."
". Kaller","3.4","30","2.7","N/A","Kaller treats her students like third graders. She turns off the lights during group discussion for us to quiet down. She lets you work with partners, but insists that you each turn in a seperate report with every word different- but still have both of your names on the project. Grades homework inconsistently. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
"Daniel Davis","4.9","72","1.8","90%","Incredibly passionate, funny, and relatable. His lectures are honestly the highlight of my week. Very caring and understanding as long as you communicate. Don't actually know if attendance is mandatory, but he takes roll every class. Absolutely take him if linguistics/English is something you're interested in."
"Chris Burke","2.3","55","3.3","100%","Dr. Burke is a very dedicated and caring professor. He knows the subject matter and practices what he preaches. He is also pulled in many directions and comes across as disorganized and slow to respond to email."
"Orin Gelderloos","4.6","45","3.4","50%","Dr G is by far the best instructor I've ever had! He is extremely knowledgeable (about EVERYTHING) and very passionate about environmental issues. He's also very accessible and willing to help you out. That being said, this is a HARD class - there 's an enormous amount of work between study guides, personal responses and other projects."
"Michael Harkness","2.5","40","4","N/A","Not the best teacher, not the worse. He will not respond to e-mail and he barely shows up for his office hours. No matter, he won't be teaching much anymore."
"Robert Steel","3","15","2.8","N/A","If you have taken any HR classes prior to Steel's, then you have already taken his class. He taught the exact same lecture as your intro HR class. Never learned anything new is his class, a waste of time and money. Yes, it is an easy A. He is slow, boring, over simplifies things (makes it seem like he is talking down to you). HORRIBLE PROFESSOR!"
"David Bedell","4.2","22","1.3","N/A","Good professor, be active with discussions in class and you will get a good grade. Has some really interesting discussions, you can learn a lot from them. Fair grader and papers are pretty short."
"Jim Nissen","4.6","101","2.2","80%","The best college class I have taken thus far. He is such a clown and knows so much about jazz and more. Grab a notebook and write down everything on his slideshows, because it is where he grabs the exam material. Don't buy the textbook, it's expensive and I barely used it. I loved coming to class because it was such a great environment. Incredible."
"Hugo Vandersypen","2.5","31","3.3","N/A","Easy class! He lets you use the book and notes on all the tests. Answers questions and is an easy grader. Only a few tests and his lectures are important. As long as you pay attention and study the information, you'll do fine."
"Frank Massey","2.8","49","3.8","100%","If I can offer any advice to taking Massey, it's this: Look at all of the old exams on his HTML-based website. Understand them inside and out. If you can do that, you will be more than prepared for the exams. I've taken him twice and gotten A's twice. His lectures are dry, but he is a nice guy and will help you outside of class if you need it."
"Saeid Baniasad","3.6","7","2.4","N/A","Good experience"
"John Devlin","3.3","55","3.6","N/A","he was good professor . thank you very much for your time."
"P Mohanty","2.1","24","4","17%","Powerpoint HEAVY! Confusing heavy point hard exams. They're not similar to study guides he gives, and he does not curve. His grading scale is also hard, a 60 is a D-!!! Average for exam was a 56.. Quizzes are also hard and not related to the ppts he loves so much. Unfortunately he's the only one to teach this class, but if you can AVOID!!!!"
"Masudur Quabili","3.4","95","2.3","100%","I wished run from this class because I understand just about 20 % of his lecture. Usually, I spended huge amount of time to study online for to do well on the test. He is not often to take attendence."
"Susan Sheth","3.5","52","1.9","N/A","Arguably the best professor at UMD. She challenges students but does it in a very clear cut way which is beneficial for anyone trying to learn communications and speech. I would definitely take her over and over again if I could!"
"Mike Foran","3.5","52","4.5","N/A","Probably one of the toughest professors at the university. Honest in what is expected of the class. Goes through each chapter and points out what you need to know (which is mostly all of it). Does homework problems in class, and tells you what to watch for. Personality wise, he's really funny and cracks jokes every couple minutes to lighten the moo"
"Mohamed Bayou","2.4","64","3.6","N/A","Professor Bayou is amazingly helpful.  Completely willing to help in office hours, always willing to entertain questions, and will go out of his way to make sure you are comfortable with the material.  He jokes around and can get off topic, but the class is good.  If you ask for help, he will give it.  I had him for 2 classes (ACC 299, 355)."
"Grace Kim","3.5","39","2.7","N/A","Makes note taking easy, lots of reading, but you can skip it if you go to class every single day. If you skip class AT ALL you will NOT pass. The lectures and handouts are where the tests come from, and she makes that very clear from day one. She is an interesting and fun instructor. Knows her stuff, and answers questions well. ^.^"
"John Fink","3.4","47","3.4","100%","Only three exams and the class is way too few credits for the material covered.  However, a very good professor who explains it well.  Fink is also glad to field questions outside of class and provides excellent feedback upon request."
"David James","4.4","45","2.8","N/A","Professor James was the best professor I have ever encountered.  He actually cares about students and wants them to pass."
"Duane Ashley","3.7","19","3.7","N/A","All I can honestly say is, DO NOT TAKE HIM! His class was by far the most stressful course I have ever taken and I only needed it as a filler course. He assigns a 7 page research paper and the mid term and final are both essay form (in which you must know every part of the textbook). Not to mention the way he grades is completely unfair!"
"Elaine Clark","4.6","60","2.3","N/A","I love Professor Clark! She always made every lecture intriguing and fun. I looked forward to every class I took from her."
"Thomas Snabb","4.6","47","2.1","100%","Professor Snabb is one of my favorite Professors of all time! I've had him for several statistics classes and I genuinely feel as soon as a semester is finished that I thoroughly understood all of the material taught in his classes. Very clear and concise."
". Papp","2.6","34","4.2","N/A","This guy knows his stuff, but does not know how to teach it too the students. Tests are hard but can be done with much effort. His lectures suck, all he likes to do is proof's. Doesnt use any numerical examples. dont take him if you dont like math!!"
"Gail McCracken","4.3","66","2.4","N/A","Great prof.  Be sure to print notes online and take notes in class.  You can use them on all tests.  She gives some extra credit.  Grades a little tough, but that's understandable since you have the answers in front of you when taking the test.  She lets class out early about half the time.  Sometimes half hour early. Take her for LE"
"Mark Guerrieri","4.9","24","1.5","N/A","He is amazing and you will learn a lot and be able to kick ass in any political discussion"
"Malayappan Shridhar","4.2","31","2.4","100%","Incredible teacher! Teaches very well and gives ample examples and repetition of material to ensure concepts stick. He can seem hard at times with his somewhat abrasive attitude towards students that don't understand or who are under prepared, however, I feel like it help push me and others harder. Very sad he is retiring soon."
"Gerald Moran","4.8","66","2.6","80%","Professor Moran is just hands down among the absolute greatest professor's I have ever taken. He keeps the class fun and engaged and really has such a way in teaching the class that it just draws you in and makes you look at things in such a different light than you would have otherwise on your own. You always walk away feeling all the wiser."
"Mike LaChance","4.2","39","3","50%","Highly recommend for D EQ w Linear Algebra. Matlab and some linear algebra concepts were confusing. LaChance communicates very well over email and Canvas so he makes up for it. During the epidemic he was just as good or better. Just take his class he's cool. It's still Differential Equations so study! Do ask for help and participate."
"Marty Hershock","4.6","61","2.9","100%","What an AMAZING professor and human being! He's also the Dean and I've never met a faculty member that truly cares about students like this! He wants them to succeed and will literally go out of his way each time to help. Sacrifices his time for students and always respond super fast. He's caring, so hilarious, smart, and super awesome, seriously!"
"Leslie Thornton","3.5","51","3.1","N/A","Dr. T was inspiration to many of us because he opened our eyes. Many of you complaining here never understood him because you chose not to hear him. Those of you complaining about the paper is most likely due to the fact that writing skills have gown down so drastically because UM-D has opened the flood gates to anyone so they can make money."
"John Gillespie","3.7","17","2.1","N/A","My favorite professor ever!!! Sad to see him leave, but I hope that he has a great retirement!"
"Marilee Parsons","2.7","41","3.4","N/A","Awesome class. Great info!!  Enjoyed the lab and extra credit!!"
"Kazem Mustafapour","3.1","20","3.3","N/A","he is one of the best professors who still teaches the old fashioned way, by giving a good lecture. his notes are enough to get an A+ in his class. a good teacher is defined by one who can explain material without using a book. take good notes, and study those. too bad he's retiring, because oelkers will suck."
"Phillip Pokorski","3.8","42","3","100%","I had reviewed this professor prior to taking his class which was mandatory, by the way, and was expecting the worst. I was pleasantly surprised by this class. As long as you pay attention to his lectures, you don't need the pathophysiology book."
"David Loosle","2.1","39","3.5","N/A","Goes way too fast, often covering 3 sections of material in an hour or less. Tests are long and difficult, makes at least 10 mistakes per class, offers extra credit in the form of quizzes but only if the whole class average is low, loves story problems a lot, and barely any partial credit. Overall nice guy, but I would avoid this professor."
"Robert Little","1.7","23","4","50%","Dr. Little is very helpful outside class. Have to work really hard on the entire project."
"Melanie Sobocinski","3.7","39","3.5","N/A","Highly recommend. Each class was so intriguing I looked forward to each class. Her knowledge is immense. The research project was a pain. The tests and quizzes were easy (just make notecards). The final was actually fun."
"Donald Miller","3.9","108","2.5","80%","The lectures are slow and quite uneventful, but you need to show up. Take good notes on what he talks about and then study them and you will do well. The exams are mostly essay/short answer, but they are not that difficult. Show up for attendance for participation points. Listening to him can be boring but it's better than reading a textbook."
"Susan Everett","2.6","33","3.8","N/A","This teacher was awful. I normally do not have a problem with my professors but she was so unhelpful. When I asked her questions she somehow confused me even more with we answers. The class time was wasted going over material unrelated to the assignments. This professor was very frustrating and handed out e's to several students!"
"Thomas Callahan","2.5","74","2.8","N/A","It's an overall easy class.The tests are word by word from the pwrpnts. However Callahan as a professor is just HORRIBLE. He assigns a 10 page paper and grades mostly on how you cite the paper and barely on the content. He makes attendance mandatory because that's how you earn participation points. His annoying jokes are soo  lame"
"Susan Waisanen","3.1","55","2.9","N/A","The class is fastpaced, but every spanish class is set to be taught the same way so that's not her fault. She tries to make the class as easy as possible. She is one of the nicest teachers i've ever had. I have never seen her yell at anyone, and she always wants us to participate and ask questions. She is very respectful. I highly recommend her."
"Lawerence Leaman","2.4","5","3.4","N/A","Should be teaching a training class for accountants, not 1st time students; doesn't explain things clear, doesn't post on blackboard; Quizzes like test, but not weighted heavily; Exams mult-choice and problems; DO The homework to learn the info, but it's not collected; Won't allow you to keep quizzes to study from;"
"Terry Faitel","5","12","1.8","N/A","I love Dr. Faitel , i took 2 math classes with her and enjoyed her class. She comes prepared, energetic and ready to teach. Tests are similar to her examples, she uses the book and summarizes the chapters in her own words to make it easy. I highly recommend her. All what she taught us in 225 was in the Basic skills test!"
"Nazih Makki","3.8","97","1.8","0%","He's a nice guy but an annoying grader. He doesn't give 20/20 and be prepared to work in groups all semester. The group assignments are easy but take all hour. The whole class is five essays and he lets you make corrections for the first to for a higher grade. YOU MUST PURCHASE the book. However I doubt you will get him because he is retiring."
"Trevor Thrall","4.4","28","3.1","N/A","really funny, but if you dont know much about the subject already you can get pretty lost. despite not knowing a lot about the subject you can still get an A bc he grades pretty easy. however if you know something about terrorism he is the person to talk to since he had hands on experience and is very knowledgeable."
"Tarek Joseph","3.7","15","2.1","N/A","Very full of himself I would never recommend taking this professor. Had a very bad experience. Very very conceded thinks he's up there. I advice to not take him."
"Lee Brooks","3.4","56","2.9","23%","Very vague when it comes to what he wants from assignments."
"Donald Anderson","3.1","18","3.7","100%","Professor Anderson was my favorite professor at Michigan.  He was challenging and intellectual and he taught me to think.  Really think.  He was caring and had my best interest at heart as a student and as a person.  I only wish I had taken all of his advice and gotten my Master's in Public Administration.  If you are serious, take him."
"Betsy Crowell","2.5","53","4.3","N/A","Crowell was horrible!! The entire dept was so steeped in their left wing dogma that they had to bring in a Prof from.EMU to teach the Econometrics class because none of the full timers had the Math chops to do it! Crowell was among the worst with her constant comparisons of US vs USSR. Little did she know the USSR would close for business!"
"P Smith","4.7","52","2.7","100%","Dr. Smith was a very pleasant professor. She explains the material very well and I always felt prepared for her weekly quizzes. She doesn't give very much homework and I even contemplated taking another Economy class because of her influence."
"E Bolling","3.2","47","3.5","N/A","Gasp! I don't know what to say... He seemed to know the material but was forgetful! Also his voice is very low and made me feel like going to sleep every class. He tried to keep us interested but I think he failed. Just try to avoid him until he retires."
"Lawrence Cohn","4.6","41","1.9","N/A","Dr. Cohn is one of the best Professors I have had at the University of Michigan Dearborn!  Explains the material very well!  Tests are extremely fair.  He Will inform you exactly what will be on the exams.  One group project which was not very difficult."
"Stana Sukunda","4.1","42","3.1","N/A","Profesora Sukunda was my favorite teacher at U of M Dearborn, and I had a lot of very helpful and knowledgeable instructors.  She is a great teacher.  She is clear, concise, and you know what is expected of you.  I found myself working harder than I might have because I wanted her approval. She really brings the best out of her students! Wonderful!"
"Gabriella Eschrich","3.9","31","2.6","50%","Arrogant  A know it all, talks down to you!  She listens to respond, not to hear."
"Dogan Koyluoglu","4.3","19","1.7","N/A","Dr. K makes learning difficult material easy. He covers all the important stuff in class. You won't get an A in this class without studying. No way, not in macroeconomics. Very fair and reasonable professor. Super nice. Incredibly helpful. Highly recommend. You will have to learn the principles of macroeconomics. But you'll enjoy it!"
"Maureen Linker","4.2","51","2.6","100%","She's awesome! If you take the lessons to heart, you'll learn a lot in this class. She's more than willing to help anytime. It's been a great experience to apply the concepts of critical thinking and see my progression as a person :). You don't realize what you take away from a class like this until way later in life."
"Rheta Rubenstein","2.4","17","4.4","N/A","This professor was a secondary educators. Her knowledge of k-8 math understanding is less than helpful and opinionated. Please try not to have an opinion or have a real life where anything happens. Smiles are given, but it is not real, nor is the concern."
"Lee Redding","3.1","31","2.9","50%","Dont take him!!!The means for the first three exams were VERY LOW and still didnt curve the final grades; he doesnt care about the implications that causes for GPAs over 1 or 2%. When he lectures he doesnt always provide detailed examples in class, nor does he have time often to go over hw probs. Tough grader, no compassion, not worth taking!"
"Mary Gell","4.6","22","1.9","N/A","Frau Gell is a great teacher. She cares a lot about her students' success and makes herself very available for extra help. She can get a little frazzled sometimes, but it never takes away from the quality of her lessons and she always ends up getting it together. I highly recommend taking a course with her."
"James Knight","1.9","32","4.6","0%","Prof Knight knows a lot about stats, but can't convey what he knows and overall is a poor teacher. He's late to class every day and will mock students who ask questions. The overhead notes are incoherent scribbling and you're basically on your own with the book. Not recommended."
"Natarajan Narasimhamurthi","3.9","23","1.9","N/A","Took him for 210 and he was awesome, so many examples I felt like I knew it so well. 3171 and 4361 not so much. He  barely gave any examples and he skiped way to many steps explaining. :"
"David Barry","4.2","7","2.4","N/A","Barry is awesome.  As a principal I use his wisdom everyday, "inspect what you expect."  He is a great asset to the UM Dearborn program."
"Wayne Woodward","3.6","36","2.9","29%","This professor is genuinely one of the worst professors I have ever had. I had to open up a dictionary to figure out the directions because he likes to sound like an ultra intellectual. He gives subjective and vague feedback on papers, so I never knew how I could improve. For your sanity, please don't take this class."
"Rebecca Wyatt","2.6","32","2.3","N/A","wyatt isnt a difficult instructor. but you have to follow her directions EXACTLY to get an A. bring other class homework to do during her class, because she goes off on irrelevant tangents. overall, totally easy."
"Charlene Meyers","3.1","30","2.9","13%","Really knowledgeable about films. Three essays with creative freedom to write. If you are a good writer this will be easy, if you struggle with writing this is probably not the class for you."
"Nilesh Patel","1.6","23","4.7","N/A","best and easiest class ever. no lab homework. whenever you have a doubt, he will explain it 'til u get it.  easy A.  Tests: easy. (multiple choice)"
"April Harden","4.2","64","2.4","100%","excellent"
"Allen Meitzler","2.2","9","3.8","N/A","This was Prof's last semester. He finally retired. I am very disappointed with Dearborn's Semiconductor/Solid State Physics class. It should be much better if we want to have a chance at competing with Ann Arbor's Semiconductor's Lab. Its really unfortunate..."
"Simboo Singh","3","51","2.9","N/A","Good Class.  Big on class discussion.  Paper is easy and 2 tests are pretty easy.  usually gives study guide or tells you whats on the exam.  hardly use the book at all."
"Lois Lamerato","4.6","25","2.2","N/A","Super easy; lets you out of class early; reads from slides; don't need textbook; takes attendance"
"Gloria House","3.9","17","2.3","N/A","One of the most inspiring Prof. I've been fortunate to sit and learn.6647"
"Lora Lempert","3.3","67","3.5","N/A","Professor Lempert is a very good professor. It is not the easiest A, but if you read the material go to some SI sessions and build some facial value with her. You will get an A. Pretty sure she has retired though."
"Mahmut Eksioglu","3","25","3.8","100%","Great teacher who makes you think and work if you are willing to. Learn"
"Ali Elkateeb","3.8","28","3","50%","Professor Elkateeb is unfortunately not in great health.  He has us grade our own homework and it became clear why, he is unable to grade them himself.  I came to him with a question on why I got a question wrong on an exam and he simply couldn't explain it.  I tried to discuss it further and he could not."
"Margret Hoft","2.7","30","3.9","N/A","Prof. Hoft is very nice. Her grading scale is somewhat forgiving, and she gives decent partial credit. A lot of the notes in class are proofs of actual "rules" (you'll see what i mean). As long as you have the drive to STUDY by yourself and ASK FOR HELP when you need it, you will be fine in her class."
"Carl Dibble","2.5","23","4.4","N/A","First of all, Carl Dibble is not even a professor. He's a "lecturer". This guy is extremely biased and his criticism is rarely constructive. There's no room for student analysis in his course---and that, to me, discourages intellectual independence as a student. I DO NOT recommend him."
". Gruber","3.3","42","3.6","N/A","Rly amazing class Very knowledgable and good discussing issues on race 3 exams, 1-2 papers, group project (ASL) partner with 1-2 people to do extensive study guide  know all questions on study guide and you should pass easily (use flashcards)  also class material that'll be on exam is given in the class prior to exam Amazing personprof"
"Deborah Pollard","3.5","46","3.4","67%","She's condescending. Marks off points on papers if you miss to quotation them right. Will never take again."
"Montaha Shamoon","2.6","30","2.1","N/A","she gets really annoyed when you ask her to explain herself or how she got to a solution and then when she does it's really hard to understand her through her accent! her grading style changes from exam to exam as well! but the exams are easy. all you have to do is study the sections she gives you for each problem and you'll be fine."
"Richard Culling","4.4","11","1.5","100%","Really enjoyed his class. Very relaxing. I think most of his grading is based on participation and favoritism though. Still, it's an Easy A."
"M. Schaum","3.7","24","2.9","N/A","She is a great professor. She is very clear with what she wants. I had her online and she is great. She is not necessarily easy in anyway you have to read and do discussion but she is very clear and nice when you ask her questions."
"Benjamin Levey","2.7","23","3.6","N/A","Lev has a great sense of humor, and was able to keep people awake even while teaching somthing as boring as statistics. Do the homework, and pay attention to in class examples. If you can do the homework you will get an A on the exams"
"Barry Wauldron","3.3","56","2.7","0%","Lectures are pointless and usually go over the time. Makes it clearly noted what way he votes and he feels about many political issues which has no place in teaching the class. Has extremely high expectations and doesn't explain how he wants high point assignments done. Gives no feedback on anything."
"Claude Jacobs","2.2","38","2.8","N/A","Professor Jacobs is a great professor and a nice person. I got a C in his Anthropology class but that's personally because I am not really interested in Anthropology so I was bored often. Everything he went over in class was on the 50-question multiple choice exam. So MAKE SURE you go over your notes. Recommended if you are fond of Anthropology."
"Wen Wu","1.8","18","3.6","100%","Wu was a very disappointing instructor for a graduate level class. His lectures are not more helpful than reading the slides. He grades exam extremely tough for minor, non conceptual mistake. He was unresponsive to emails and spoke disparagingly of online students, as if they deserved lesser education than in person. Worst of any I have had. AVOID!"
"Sheryl Pearson","3.9","24","3.7","N/A","Professor Pearson is a nice lady. This was a upper level online course and let me tell you be ready to work hard! 2-3 discussions a week as well as 3 big assignments. You have to read lots of novels each discussion needs to be as long as a essay. She expects a lot. Expect to work very very hard!! It not impossible though i ended up with a B."
"Marissa Stepien","4.8","46","2.2","N/A","Professor Perez is amazing! She loves to make everyone in the class participate and makes sure that everyone stays on task. She definitely helps everyone when she can, and tells you everything that will be on the exams, so there are no surprises. Love her teaching style and would definitely recommend her to anyone!"
"R Straub","3.2","32","3.1","50%","This guy literally assigns his own textbook as the textbook for the class to read. Then he comes in for lecture and repeats everything that you read in the textbook. This man thinks writing vocab terms from the textbook is a study guide and they're not on the test! You take an exam that has questions that weren't in the lecture or the textbook. SMH"
"Andrew Wright","2.4","68","2.6","25%","Doesn't grade harshly. There are a decent amount of assignments you have to complete, but if you do them based on his requirements he lists for that assignment, he will give you full credit. You don't have to worry about being 100% correct in your answer as long as you have a strong argument and are on the right track."
"Jerome Assenmacher","3.8","15","3.8","N/A","He is a nice guy, and he knows his stuff.  as far as exams, the problems are like the HW, and he usually hints at which ones to study, the Multiple choice questions are hard, but in the book or power point slides. HW problems are long, but are basically what ends up on exam, so worth doing and he collects certain HW. Overall hard but fair class."
"William McNeece","2.4","85","3.9","N/A","Where do I begin? Professor McNeece was not that bad, but he is a tough grader. He takes up  the class time on just one definition, and gets mad when students are late to class, when he is a about 5 to 10 minutes late every class period. The only thing I liked about this class was the book he assigned and Heather the SI leader. She really rocked!"
"Julia Kelly","3","47","3.2","N/A","Professor Kelly was a really sweet, helpful woman. Although confusing at times, I made it through the lab section with no huge problems. I didn't understand how the labs supplemented the lectures, but that isn't a huge issue. Would definitely take again, if I had to."
"Angeliki Salamaleki","4.4","5","2.2","N/A","the best"
"John Riebesell","3.2","27","3","N/A","Popgen wasnt supposed to be hard. Got a B- but could hv easily done better & regret not focusing more on notes. Memorize all notes and handouts and u'll be set for exams! He does adjust the scale for every exam -- a huge help. 1 short essay for all/nothing credit. Can hv few absences but then starts taking off pts. Lecture is just copying notes."
"Brooks Hull","3.8","76","3.5","N/A","Even though he retired after this semester, if he decides to teach again only take him if you want a class to keep yourself awake in. Very little get A's and very little fail as he is a tough grader. Learned a lot but grades do not always show it. Very humorous professor though."
"Mario Bonfiglio","4","62","2.8","100%","This professor is the best. He doesn't give too many homework and most of the grading depends on the exams which are 70% of the grade. At least Five extra credit which worth 5 grades in the whole grade. Remember you will need to pay $115 for Cengage to do the web assign which worth 5% of your grade."
"Carolyn Kraus","4.4","27","3","100%","Great feedback on writing. You will definitely learn."
"Nancy Meyer","4.4","50","2.3","100%","The best professor I've ever had. Always open to helping others and is so caring."
". Nelson","4.9","23","1.4","N/A","Prof Nelson is awesome. He gave so much extra credit which helps so much! Questions for the tests from the book chapter tests. Collects homework for points and offers extra credit for perfect attendance. He's a high school math teacher and I think that is why he explains the concepts so well and is so helpful. If you struggle with math take him!!"
"Anthony Dalimonte","4.3","19","1.4","100%","I took Professor Dalimonte in the summer. The class has a decent amount of work, but if you put some effort into it, he grades quite easily. Its been a pretty easy class so far. He has 1 test and around 3 presentations. My test is next week and I will come back to edit the rating based on that."
"Julie Dziekan","4.3","29","2.3","100%","Took her for OB510 online. Expect weekly chapters to read and weekly discussion participation. Exams were mostly related to the lecture notes (powerpoint slides) that she provides for you."
"David Susko","4.8","24","2.8","84%","Such a handsome man, and a great teacher"
"Marshall Hunt","3.8","12","4.3","N/A","Exams average were always around 70s. he doesn't curve usually, but he did this time in every exam. and drops out lowest exam.NOT EASY.at least they way he teaches this class makes it impossible to get an A, unless you leaned accounting and taxation somewhere else. He is not helpful when it comes to preparing for an exam. Exams open books and notes"
"Oleg Zikanov","3.5","12","3.3","100%","He gives timed exams for Matlab-coding. For a 2 credit class, he does way too much. If you don't know how to use MATLAB, you can not get higher than a C which is very unfair. He doesn't care to help you, his exams are very advanced MATLAB questions, which is very difficult for beginners. Don't take him for this class!"
"Lawrence Radine","3.8","69","3.1","N/A","awesome prof.  too bad he's retiring.  you will be missed"
"Francis Wayman","3.5","52","3.7","62%","I am now a senior at U of M-Dearborn and I told myself I would not take Professor Wayman again but I had no choice. This class was horrible, he is constantly late and puts you to sleep. Half the things he explains in class are not on the exam and he favors certain students. You get half multiple choice/essay exams that are very hard. BEWARE"
"Kenneth Ayouby","3.5","38","3","N/A","He is by far the best professor Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He grades you based on your effort not on your exams which means not only does he care about you as a human but he cares about your future!!!!!"
"Peggy Foss","N/A","","N/A","N/A",""
"Marykay Carter","3.3","63","4.2","N/A","Terrible Prof and Terrible person!"
"Barbara Matthei","3.6","54","3.1","N/A","Any type of question is treated like a dumb question, can be rudeimpatient, allows calculators, drops lowest exam, counts quiz average as an exam which is helpful, tests can be tough, homework isn't collected but quizzes take problems from the hw, goes over examquizhw questions if asked, 3 Mathematica labs, lectures are decent. Alright class."
"Thaddeus Radzilowski","3.7","37","3.1","50%","He is obviously a brilliant man, but a dry lecturer. Lectures with almost no visual aids, will often go off-topic for some obscure anecdote that will not apply to any test, very dry stuff. Expects participation for reading the assigned books but didn't actually asks questions. The book will give you 90% of test answers... but the book is boring too"
"Jack Wayne","4.9","14","1.5","N/A","Dr. Wayne was one of the most influential educators I have ever had the pleasure to study under.  He brought a real life presence to every subject."
"Marilyn Rosenthal","N/A","","N/A","N/A",""
"Steve Sharbatz","4.1","11","2","N/A","excellent teacher! <3"
". Padmanabhan","2.8","21","3.2","N/A","Easy class and teacher but I agree he needs to like your writing style.  He wants your opinion and for you to own it.  you don't have to agree with him on case studies but you can't back down you need to back up your opinion.  Got an easy A group work seems long but its really easy.  lots of presenting in front of the class tho"
"Chris Tabor","1.8","9","2.7","N/A","I took Tabor at HFCC;he is very immature (nothing ever made sense).I would ver take him again, and I would not advise u to either."
"Edwin Petty","3.8","3","2","N/A","I have no clue what I learned in the class. Technology is good? I half paid attention did none of the reading and barely helped write part of a group paper. There were no tests. I got a B. He likes when you talk in class which was easy for me because I always had a few drinks before attending."
"Dongming Zhao","2.1","25","3.7","34%","A programming instructor who doesn't even program in lecture, only goes over Powerpoint Slides and basic explanations, skipping over so many important elements of programming. Programming assignments are ridiculously difficult compared to lecture. Horrible professor."
"Mary Trepanier-Street","3.3","6","3.7","N/A","Took her a few years ago. I never want to have to deal with her. She favors the talkative ones who are just there to be there and gives them undeserved grades on their papers when she grades tougher on the hard workers who may just be quiet.She's good at lectures but hate favoritism."
"Onur Ulgen","2.9","9","3.6","N/A","IMSE 5655 is for students/professionals that want to understand how MRP systems work.  Not conceptually the role they play in the business environment, but mathematically how the data is being crunched behind the scenes.  Completely useless in application unless you plan on becoming an MRP software programmer???"
"Paul Buczkowski","3.1","33","1.4","86%","Easy teacher, go to class and you guarantee an A."
"Moulouk Berry","4.4","17","2.1","N/A","Wonderful professor with a lot of knowledge. She's very open to other opinions though she'll argue with you about it throughout the class time. Teaching is great, material is great, exams were not difficult, they were based on what we learned in class rather than on the objectives. Recommended, 9/10."
"Vivek Sharma","2.5","15","3.5","N/A","His teaching is very clear, and conceptually he is sound. He uses slides that are crisp & communicates ideas well. Sometimes drags out a topic. Very helpful, open book exam, mcqs mostly, but need to have read the book or wouldn't be able to crack it within the time given. Good course. I learnt A LOT! Accent might be an issue w some, but not too bad"
"Cynthia Blasses","3.2","20","3.4","N/A","Good macro prof, good solid teaching style, informative, makes concepts easy to understand."
"Richard Nadalini","3.9","17","3.8","N/A","Fair grader, will call on you during class so do the assignments. 3 quizzes & 3 tests. HW is factored into the grade as is participation in class.  Take notes &READ THE BOOK. This is not an easy A. He will tell you what will be on the test, but will NOT allow you to keep old test which I thought was stupid. Overall, he is a good teacher, but"
"Karen Rapp Schultes","2.7","29","3.1","N/A","Thought she was pretty good.  Tests and workload were on par for a masters level course.  Exams were somewhat long and difficult, but if you attend lecture and read the book you will be fine."
"David Skrbina","4","81","2.3","100%","PROS: *Clear grading criteria *Helps you think outside the box *Witty and interesting *Tests are based directly off the study guide CONS: *You have to buy his specific book CONCLUSION: *You only need a 88% for an A and the class itself is very straightforward. There are also multiple extra credit opportunities."
"Ani Kasparian","4.5","2","3.5","N/A","Best teacher I have ever had! She expects you to do the work given. She is a tough cookie to crack."
"Donald F. Rossin","3.1","29","2.3","N/A","good professor"
"Chundao Che","3.9","5","3.6","N/A","He definitely knows a lot about what he is teaching. Though he's sometimes hard to understand, he's very thorough in his lectures.  Basically every question on the exams comes from his lectures, so as long as you pay attention and take notes, you'll be fine."
"Jean Saillant","3.2","51","4","50%","Not the most personable professor and can come across rude. She is not super approachable for help so go to SI. There are much better A&P instructors out there. You must attend lecture and record it if that helps."
"Judith Geary","4.3","13","3","100%","Professor Geary is an amazing Professor who gives the students an outline that tells us what she expects on the tests. There are three exams and three essays that are relative easy. she gives back great feedback and is an easy grader! I learned a lot from this class and I'm glad i was able to take a class with her! She is very knowledgable!"
"Kenneth Johnson","4.6","8","2.1","N/A","Nice, but difficult tests. Grades papers depending without much transparency. Otherwise, great guy and good lectures!"
"Timmothy Talty","4.3","8","2.5","100%","Had prof. Talty for ECE500 and ECE580.  I enjoyed both classes and did well in them.  He is very good at lecturing and generally lays things out in an easy-to-understand manner.  He does assign some homework, and this helps a ton on the tests.  Projects are intriguing, gives you some real life application. Lenient grader"
"Paul Sunstein","2.6","33","3.9","15%","It's been 3 years and I'm still traumatized. Stay away from his class at all costs!"
"David Waknine","2.5","31","3.6","N/A","Rude megalomanic! Purposely tries to make course as unpleasant as possible under the guise that the more people that drop, the more "robust" his class must be. Despite the fact that the content is not difficult."
"Gordon Harnadek","4.5","15","2.7","N/A","amazingly professional teacher. Pretty consistant, very very honest            he was a doctor (for you BIO nerds out there) and a pretty damn perstegious teacher compared to others. just be respectful and keep your ears open and youll have no pronlem passing his class."

"Mesut Duran","4.8","10","2.1","100%","Take Mr. Duran no matter what! There is no one in the world as kind as him! The class material is clear and encourages you to email him if you have any questions. Do yourself a favor, if you genuinely want to learn in a positive environment take him.

"Randy Stevenson","N/A","","N/A","N/A",""
"Tom Schoenemann","4.4","13","2.5","N/A","Prof Schoenemann is by far my favorite professor at IU. Sure, he rambles, but he is incredibly knowledgeable and always interesting. He loves to keep lectures entertaining but showing videos and telling jokes/stories. You'll learn a lot from him if you are engaged in the material. Plus, lectures are never boring because he's quite the silver fox ;)"
"Diane Graves-Oliver","4.4","29","2.6","N/A","Dr Oliver is probably the best teacher I've had in undergrad thus far. Extremely helpful, encouraging, funny, and nice. I took her class at Hood College in Maryland (there's no profile for her with Hood so I'm reviewing her here). Anyway, take her class, you will want to major in Psych if you're not already."
"Saida Benromdhane","2.4","4","3.3","100%","She was very helpful in the class"
"Naeem Seliya","2.8","14","3.2","N/A","Knowledgable about subject and field, and helpful to me in and out of class. Course was hard with lots of work; but it is a 4 credit course! duh! I recommend him highly. Very few faculty here connect so well with students like Dr Seliya does. Go Jim!"
"Ray Perez","4.9","5","4.2","N/A","BEST TEACHER AT UMICH!  Ancient Greek is a hard language and Prof. Perez made himself available before and after class to make sure everyone learned the language."
"Xiangyang Li","2","5","2.4","N/A","This prof took 2 hours of the first class to go over a 2 page self explanatory sllybus. He made me cry when i asked for help and thinks no one takes school seriously...his lectures are pointless, read the book and do all the labs and you can get an A, but be prepared to teach yourself."
"Ahmad Farhat","5","13","1.8","100%","Good lab professor for 150. Very eager to assist and help, but quite passive aggressive (he does yell/scream at you)."

"Seth Hirshorn","1.8","9","3.1","N/A","Unfortunately Professor Hirshorn does not provide feedback in a timely manner.  He will repeat lectures week after week and I had him two consecutive semesters, attended classes and he did not know my name.  On average the overall class attendance was 50 %."
"Mike Callahan","4","16","2.3","25%","Professor Callahan was awesome! He was very informative and knew what he was talking about. If you skip more than 2 classes you won't get an A. His grading system is great. Starts from 0 and you work your way up."
"Debalina Bandyopadhyay","4.4","18","2.7","N/A","there are only 3 real chem professors at UMD. dr. deb, dr. b, and dr. bazzi is halfway decent. this is the best professor out of all of them tho. she explains things so clearly that anyone can understand them. you don't even need to open the freakin book ffs. just study the darn notes, and get an A."
"Francisco Sturla","3.4","4","3.5","0%","Makes many mistakes during lectures, rarely goes back to correct them. All the points are in the exams, which are difficult. Would not recommend for Masters students."
"German Reyes","3.4","12","3.5","100%","Horrible professor who speaks in a monotone. get ready to have the most boring class of your life if you choose to take one of his classes. The course was already hard as it was and all this professor did was make it harder with his monotonous lectures and no homework nor any help on how to solve the practice problems."
"Nancy Spence","3.9","6","2.2","N/A","We had 4 lesson plans, 4 papers, a take home midterm and a take home final. Was a pretty easy and non-stressful class. However, shes pretty boring! But her class isn't hard."
"Alan Fisk","3.3","27","2.7","N/A","Professor Fisk is brutally honest, but if you're going into journalism he is a must take. He has tons of real world experience, and may come off as a jerk, but he is very helpful and easy compared to what you will face in real world editors. Take his class and embrace all of the suggestions when re-writing your assignments."
"Diane Oliver","4.1","34","3","N/A","She is AWESOME!  Her exams can be diffucult due to all the information you need to know, but this class was very enjoyable and fun!! Take her if you have a chance!!"

"Stephen Brooks","3.6","8","3.3","N/A","Pretty boring. Lectured non-stop for nearly the entire 3 hours of the class--not much discussion. Seems like a nice enough guy, the work is challenging, you can learn a decent amount. I wouldn't really recommend though unless you're very interested in the subject."
"John Burks","3.2","48","2.3","N/A","This class was super long but not too bad. has interesting stories and not a tough grader but test are hard to study for and the book chapters are extremely long. gets off track which is fine until u have to prepare for the exam."
"Brian Murphy","2.3","5","3.4","N/A","If you take his online course and don't get an A it's you with a problem, not him. Expectations and assignments are plainly printed in the syllabus from the start. If you're looking for a challenging course this one may disappoint, but it definitely isn't going to stress you."
". Ziolkowski","4.8","5","1.4","N/A","He is very friendly and treats all of his students with respect! No tests. There is just a research project and a few short papers. I was very glad I took this class because it was a pleasant experience."
"Kirk Philipich","3.3","39","3.3","100%","Very controversial professor, he either likes you or he doesn't. Overall his quizzes were challenging but If you study you will do fine & his grading scale is beyond easy. But get on his good side..."
"Nasser Shauibi","5","1","1","N/A","Awesome teacher, very thorough explanations, exams are from lecture. Highly recommended."
"Atallah Al Turfe","3.2","123","2.9","50%","So basically this guy kind of teaches himself, he writes problems on the board , doesnt explain anything has no dialogue with the class, skips steps in his problems and expects us to know what he did, and gets irritated if you ask questions. HIGHLY RECOMMEND A DIFFERENT TEACHER"

"Belinda Lazarus","3.9","9","3.7","N/A","She is one of the best Professors in the U of M School of Ed. Very kind, and fair. She is really knowledgeable about SPED. Her wealth of knowledge will be terribly missed by all of her students."
"Seong Hong","3.1","14","3.6","50%","This teacher was kind, but WOW, the amount of work she assigned was OVERWHELMING! Being a full-time student, I put most of my energy into this class! It was challenging. We had to complete practical hours and create 3 inquiry plans. The professor was understanding; she allowed us to redo some assignments, but there was just so much work to handle."
"Jamie Lee","3.8","55","2.5","47%","this was a super easy class to take but get ready to write assignments nearly each week. each week you will have to write on the readings that are discussed that week. but the assignments are super easy to write and do not require intense critical thinking. many opportunities to get extra credits (even with participance in class)."
"Tina Lam","3.6","5","3.8","N/A","I was worried about this class at the beginning of the semester, but it ended up being my favorite. Tina is extremely knowledgeable about the material; I learned so much from the class. Class discussions are always interesting.

"Phil Santoro","2.5","4","1.8","N/A","The comment about the class work is true. The two exams are ridiculously long essay exams. The lectures are very boring & you will struggle to figure out what info will need for test. The class isn't hard; just a lot of writing. You will have to watch several   documentaries & write reviews."

"Mark Reynolds","3.9","60","2.8","100%","Understanding the papers mark assigns for readings requires a high knowledge of physics and astronomy. He doesn't expect very detailed reports on them, and doesn't require you to understand them, but don't expect to know what's going on in class. He's also a big stickler for little things like contractions which is pretty annoying."
"Elsie Peck","3","6","3.3","N/A","I got an A. This is what you should do. Go to class, don't take notes, just listen and familiarize yourself with the pics. On the review day only, record lecture, and take pics with your phone. Go home and match pics with notes. She'll show you about 50 images & test you on 14.1 quiz (can be dropped). Mid-Term,Final and 1 Paper (time consuming)"
"Britta Roan","4.9","4","1.3","N/A","Like the other ratings say, she's awesome. She's simply there for guidance and has a lot of experience and knowledge to offer. Open to any questions and doesn't judge anyone. She's a sweetheart and is extremely helpful with careers. You have to ask specific questions though or you won't get answers that pertain to your specific interests."
"Michael Favor","3.5","2","2.5","N/A","Funny guy with good stories but class is a cluster.  Chemistry (Chemical) knowledge is a must, especially the way he teaches.  He is not clear on grading scale and policies.  Some people get same exact answers marked wrong while others have it right."

Her tests aren't too bad and she really prepares you for them. She gives you literally everything that you need to pass, so as long as you practice the language you should be fine. Definitely one of my favorites"
"Jamie Ward","4.5","27","2.1","N/A","she can be a bit high maintenance for a lower level introductory class especially in a major as easy as communication."
"Sarah Byrd","2.5","2","2","N/A","Doesn't teach - probably has a lot of information to share but she is lazy. She has students do all the work, including bringing in their own "experts" to teach the material while the prof sits and listens."
"Kristen Cicotte","3.2","12","3.3","N/A","Prof is great, very nice and understanding. Material is hard and demanding, but it's accounting so nothing new there. Study Study Study, do HW before class, ask questions even if you are remotely confused - chance is you're missing something that will get you on the test! She does a great job of trying to explain everything with real world examples"
"Warren Evans","4.8","5","1.8","N/A","Mr.  Evans does not teach the class but has appointed someone to fill in for him.   The instructor is highly knowledgeable in the cybercrime field.  Attendance is important.  You might do a in class assignment and one homework assignment but they are fairly easy.  You do need to study for the multi-choice final exam.  Overall all you can get an A."
"Simona Mirincean","3.9","4","4.3","N/A","This is a organic course so the material is a little challenging. I liked her exams better than DeCamp and she was more clear on mechanisms during lecture. While she's a little bit easier the exams are still hard and some questions she gives are curve balls. Overall she is a good professor if you know the reactions and mechanisms."

"Joann Riley","1.8","19","4.3","N/A","Very tough grader, but it is possible to get an A.  You have to be willing to put the time into your revisions and ask her exactly what you did wrong.  Basically, suck up to her and put time into your revisions and you will be fine. She is, however, very judgmental and I honestly don't think she realizes it."
"Martha Rowland","2.9","48","3.8","34%","This professor is really something else. Her lectures barley cover the material, so make sure you read! She doesn't curve, round or give partial credit. She also refuses to teach how to do some of the math problems."
"Kirsten Dara Hill","3.1","20","3.6","72%","This class started off very confusing because there was almost no directions given. After I got the hang of how her class works I started to do well and enjoy it more. It is a fairly enjoyable class because we read several different books. Not difficult at all and she replies to emails quickly/ grades fast."
"Bruce Bublitz","3.9","25","2.2","67%","Bubz is the man. Take him this summer (2018) before it's too late because he's retiring afterwards. Tests are impossible but don't sweat it, there's a huge curve and everyone passes with relative ease.

"Anne-Marie Yerks","2.9","27","2.1","N/A","Personality wise she should be an elementary teacher. She is one of those adults that thinks she knows everything about teenagers but she is mad wrong.

Required 10hr tutoring, 2 uninformative books, so many tough weekly assignments on Canvas, a difficult midterm& final. Group presentations added to the stress. The only positive aspect was creating a resumes & portfolio. Overall, not a great way to start a degree."
"Jessica Ryder","2.7","37","3.3","50%","This class is an easy A if youve taken band/music classes for years. If not, the class will feel very fast paced & you will notice that she is using vocab that you dont understand to describe more words that you dont understand. She assigns A LOT of reading, but youll to score really well on the tests if you actually read!! All lecture"
"Christopher Novak","4.9","17","2.5","N/A","Dr. Novak is just simply a great professor. He takes a very diffcult subject and makes it understandable and not as scary as many math students probably foreshadow calc to be. Highly reccomend his class for math majors."
"Aarre Laakso","4.1","18","2.6","100%","reading the textbook isn't necessary for this class, most necessary information is available in the slides. notes are very easy to access, and the teacher is very responsive to your feedback in regards to tests. the class should be really easy if you take good notes and study a bit.
there's no homework or final exams either."
"Gail Leura","2.9","6","2.5","N/A","Professor Luera is one of my favorite professors so far. I am not sure where these other commenters are getting their opinions, but if they had the same teacher as me than they are the problem. All of her expectations are clear, her class was perfectly setup and I have learned more in her class than any other here so far."

"Julie Prokop","3.1","8","3.9","0%","This "Digital Photography" intro course is ridiculous. No textbook or tests, just absorb as much as you can from lecture (which assumes too much prior knowledge from students). Not accessible outside of class (she says she has kids and that she rarely responds to email). If you know photoshop well, this is simple, if not, don't bother."

"Shang-Tae Yee","1.5","1","3","N/A","He does not speak English well so if you have a question, do not bother asking.  The averages on the midterm and final were around 60%.  I did well only because I memorized the definitions of the bold words in the chapters.  If you do this and pay attention in class you can get an A."
"Richard Rischar","3","20","3.2","N/A","Requires outside reading in addition to the textbookweekly lessons & assigned literature readings even though the college grading rubric doesn't require outside reading for grading purposes and gives poor grades if you don't do it.  Grades tests off of outside reading material rather than the course textbook. Makes rude comments to students."

But as the class progressed, it didn't turn out to be so bad and may have sparked a tad bit of interest in the subject. Not a blowoff but not difficult either. Gives study guides before tests."

The entire class dreaded going and rejoiced when it was over."

"Yung-Wen Liu","2.9","12","3.7","N/A","Gives easy examples during lecture while quizzes, homework, and TESTS are impossible. He tells you everything is okay even if its really not. Hard to get a good grade but you learn a decent amount. Don't take unless its your last resort."

I hate that some assignments were due at 5p.m instead of 11:59 p.m. Her lectures can sometimes be very heavy, a lot of information being thrown at you.

Ecology is a great class with material that will really expand your understanding of biological concepts."
"Jeffrey Grupp","4.6","15","1.6","N/A","Almost every lecture made us take a two point quiz about the last lecture with two questions, you could only pick one. It was short answer to your best ability. No final or midterm. No tests, notes, book, or homework. Best part is he was so engaging I still remember everything we discussed without notes or studying."

"John C. Black","4.1","11","2.6","N/A","Professor Black is awesome. SO understanding and brings a lot to the classroom. He has A LOT of experience and loves to share. Only downfall is that he is very opinionated. Helpful, nice, and really funny. Easy  class as long as you try. Participation and attendance is graded, but his class was pretty much all discussion. Learned a lot and enjoyed."
"Tiffany Marra","3.6","4","2.8","N/A","class assignments allowed me to work on projects that will help me prepare for getting a job.  Best class was learning about all of the different projects others students were working on and how different they were."
"Matthew Wimble","3.8","15","2.5","84%","I have now taken Wimble for ITM 371 and 351 and both classes were great! 371 is especially awesome because of how relevant and up to date the class is. The tests are fair and he provides study guides and reviews that are very helpful. The papers in both classes are annoying and long but doable."
"Lisa Martin","4.3","26","2.9","86%","Dr. Martin is a super nice and laid-back professor. Yes, there was quite a bit of writing to do for this course. But, she was nice about grading and did her best to create the best learning environment possible. Very interesting course as well. Learning about the various issues women face was definitely helpful. I strongly recommend her!"
"Gary Crosbie","3.8","2","3.5","N/A","If you show up to lecture, do the work as assigned and read the book you will be fine in his class. Gets a bad rap since he is a bit of a goofy guy and can occasionally get off topic, but he presents the subject well and makes sure every student has the tools to succeed."
"Sonja Wang","3.4","4","2.8","N/A","I loved her class. Yes her instructions are somewhat unclear at times but she will clarify if you ask. No tests, 3 small quizess, 3 main projects. Would take a class by her again."
"Shyamala Mourouvapin","2.3","5","4.2","N/A","She does a 160 on you at anytime. At first she came off very helpful and friendly, but as the semester went on her attitude completely changed and not for the better. She assigns homework the night before that takes hours and expects us to have it for her the next day. STUPID. Don't take her, ever. Doesn't understand the learning process."
"Matt Barnhart","2.4","6","4.2","N/A","Barnhart, was a great Prof., he gave out a lot of work but he do care that you learn and get what you pay for. I enjoyed his class long lectures, it's all for your benefit, he does get you ready for the real world. His information will help you to through you career. I will remember a lot of his stuff on my path in the real world."
"Lisa Van Havermaet","4.9","11","1.3","N/A","Amazing teacher. Interesting and funny. Great class. Just show up to lecture and pay attention for an A. Exams are easy and straight forward basics with no tricks."

"Justin Saarinen","4.1","4","2.5","N/A","Prof. Saarinen is an extremely knowledgeable individual in the GIS labs at UMD. His expertise and passion for GIS and Remote Sensing (excellent course) inspire high quality work. The real world examples and clear instruction he provides makes the complex nature of GIS and remote Sensing more manageable to master. Excellent course, excellent Prof."
"Hongtae Kang","3","6","2.5","34%","Thick accent. Joking too much. Mocked students for wrong answers in class. Too much matrix calculations on the exams, so nobody could complete the problems on the 2nd exam(he said so). However,after this failure, he adjusted his original grading scale, so more people could pass the course. Lecture slides he provided were just scans of the textbook."
"D.J. Osborn","3.5","4","2.8","N/A","not the best but not the worst. He's pretty picky about everything. You have to do it his way. Do not under any circumstance expect to get a 100% there will always be minus half a point here and another there. He likes some more than others and you can tell because he gives this facial expression when certain people ask questions. Don't recommend"
"Farah Kawtharani","3.4","7","3","50%","Prof. Kawtharani was a solid professor. I came in only knowing how to speak Arabic & she covered all the basics effectively. However, because I didnt know much, I would have preferred more organized lectures. She also picks on students to read and answer questions on the spot. Wish my grade was rounded. Overall she is an understanding, nice woman."
"David Yeakel","3.3","5","3.8","100%","Great lecturer. If you participate, it actually does make the class more enjoyable. Makes you think. He'll convince you the wrong answer is correct so always be on top the idea if it seems iffy."
"Samuel Iles","N/A","","N/A","N/A",""
"Trevor Iles","4.8","10","1.9","100%","Great and funny professor. The course is neither hard nor easy some of the written assignments need a bit of creative thinking. The tests are all from power points. No textbook needed. There is one group project."

"Daniel Rosenbaum","5","1","2","N/A","Dr Rosenbaum is a great professor, he is very knowledgable on many things not just Sociology. He helps you in so many ways. There are a few in class writing assignments and an oral presentation which is very easy. I would recommend this class by all means, he is the best professor and he makes his class very interesting. Definately recommend"
"Joe Lo","3.4","4","2.1","N/A","Professor Lo is not the worst teacher I've had, he's pretty lenient and can be funny at times. However, all he does is read off powerpoints, so some people skip his class. Grading scale is nice. NEVER answers emails. Ever. Something I extremely dislike. He opened his canvas in front of us once and he had 230+ emails that were never read. Not cool."
"David Lambert","3.5","1","2","N/A","I am currently taking introduction to photography with David and he's a really cool, laid back professor.  He is very quick responding to e-mails to answer any questions one may have about the class.  He is also a professional and VERY passionate photographer.  I hope this class is offered more regularly...I highly recommend him!"
"Arifa Javed","2.5","18","3.2","12%","Understanding her lectures and all is easy, but you basically have less than 10 assignments in this class. There are 2 tests, participation points, and 1 group project for the whole semester. She does round your grade and is very understanding if you take the time. She loves participation and really appreciates people coming to her office hours."
"Larissa Sano","4.9","6","2","100%","Took this class back in Winter 2011 (Bio 315 - Aquatic Ecosystems). She was such an amazing & caring professor. Her lectures are informative, clear and precise. She cares about her students and goes out of her way to make sure they are successful. Tests were fair, and the class was super fun. Got to go on a trip outdoors for one of our projects."
"Zeina Alsalman","3.6","7","2","N/A","the best professor I ever had. She tries her best to make sure everyone understand the material. she gives 5 quizzes, 3 exams and a case study. Take her class, you will like it."
"Benjamin Levey","3.5","13","3.1","N/A","His class was largely based on readings so buy the books, make time for them, and take notes. The info in the class in interesting but lecture was slightly boring. Attend class because he sums up what you will need to know for tests. Your grade is based only on a mid-term, final and term paper so be well prepared for all three."
"Muniba Saleem","4.5","23","3.4","N/A","Professor Saleem is amazing! Every lecture was a pleasure to be in. She is so eloquent, clear and gives great examples and fun videos every class. I even went to class when I had a cold because I didn't want to miss her lecture! It's too interesting and everytime I left I felt like I was opened to a new perspective. Expect to work and write"
"Brian Bartek","2.6","28","3.3","N/A","Do yourself a favor and don't take his class. He gives most quizzes online they're extremely difficult and you're never given enough time. He isn't clear with what he expects for assignments or tests, and he teaches as if his students have the same amount of education and knowledge that he has. Also, Study guides are useless."
"Kinine Comstock","2.6","7","3.1","N/A","greatest teacher for biochem 1 lecture. her slides make everything clear and simple. there should be no reason to do bad in this class if you put in the time."
"Zhimin XI","1","1","5","N/A","Hilarious, inspirational, and always there for you while she flunks you"

"Lindsay Todd-Colby","5","19","2.3","100%","She is just amazing! She is so sweet and understanding and she truly wants her students to learn!"
"Kim Yangjin","2","1","3","N/A","Kim is a bit difficult to understand, not very clear. If you take his class, you need to read the textbook and do problems on your own. If you're not willing to learn the material yourself, you won't do well, because he doesn't teach clearly. But an A is possible if you put in effort. He's a sweet guy and is very smart, just bad at explaining."
"Gargi Ghosh","2","4","3.8","0%","Very hard to understand and flies through lectures, not a good combo. Write down/memorize literally everything she says because the slides alone arent enough to prepare you for the exam. Grades tough, if you miss a word or 2 you MIGHT get half credit. Quizzes (10% total) are just as hard as exams (20% each) so good luck. Old material is your friend"
"Suzanne Hodge","1","1","5","N/A","I do not recommend her. Many times I felt confused because she seemed confused."
"Malinda Mansour","4.8","28","2.6","100%","This professor was amazing! I walked into the class thinking that I would hate it, and walked out a changed individual. She really throws herself into the part, and it makes the lectures much more engaging."
"Samara Anarbaeva","4.6","7","2","N/A","Great class - I learned so much about the use of Social Media in the PR world."
"Stephanie Miller","5","1","4","N/A","If you are into biology, you will definitely enjoy this class. I was amazed by the amount of work we were able to complete in a summer course. Since I enjoy biology, this course was definitely worth my time. However if you are taking the class because it count for pre-med, I've seen those kids whining over the amount of materials they had to do."
"Tarek Aboujoud","3.5","1","4","N/A","Aboujoud is a really nice guy. However, he can't teach if his life depended on it. I would recommend him."
"Justin Pletzke","5","4","1","N/A","Great professor. If you can take him, TAKE HIM. Absolutely recommend."
"Bilal Muhammad","4.8","18","1.4","100%","Prof. Muhammad is my favorite professor by far. His lectures are interesting and he's really understanding when it comes to assignments. Tells you exactly what he wants in terms of assignments and will give a good grade if you do what he asks. If you're planning on taking CRJ 200, I recommend you take it with him."
"Nevrus Kaja","3.8","13","3.6","58%","yes"
"Michael Morris","4.3","8","3","100%","Excellent professor. Really cares about his students and his discussions are really engaging. He elevates the discussion by getting students to think abstractly and likes to push our minds to the limit. His tests are tough but fair. He is a super smart man and he really knows his stuff. Would Highly recommend. Would definitely take again."
"Aaron Harrter","5","2","1.5","N/A","Loved the classes. This guy knows his stuff and is really passionate about it. Makes classes informative and enjoyable. Inspires you to read greek philosophy in greek.Tells you what to study for quizzes. (predictable), easy grader. Use the book every day,w weekly quizzes help your grade."
"Jeff Frost","5","10","2.1","100%","Such an admirable man. The tests are not the easiest but they are great if you look over the book chapters and the lecture slides before hand. There are many opportunities for points and a great honors option. He gives you the book for free, king."
"Shawna Reynolds","3.8","10","2.6","67%","The exams were not difficult, just read her slides and then use the textbook for a little more detail. The final is a take home long paper (8-10 pages) which can be time consuming but is on an interesting topic. She talks a lot about her former experiences working in corrections which is cool!"
"James Boileau","4.8","9","2","100%","One of the best professors I've had. Has very interesting and useful lectures. His industry experience and materials covered in this class are so helpful for actual engineering working knowledge."
"Christine Hampton","1.5","3","4.3","0%","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I passed the class using YouTube videos and seeking tutoring. Do not believe what she post in the syllabus. She did not utilize the book or posted the homework that she said she would."
"James Woodland","4.3","8","1.3","80%","Come to class and you will get an A. Easy task as the class was over an hour and we never stayed longer than 30 minutes. You do small group discussions most of the time and after discussing we would leave. NO pre test/essay, in class essays, 10 page essay most comp 106 have to do, or a final exam or essay. Final was putting your old essays in a doc"
"Klaus Tappe","4.3","6","3.3","100%","He is so kind and caring. He took late assignments for me and was understanding. German is a hard language to learn, but this guy isn't out to get you. He gives tests that are clear and easy to pass, even if you're not very good with the material. There is quite a bit of online homework, but if you stay on top of it, the class will be a breeze."
"Steffan Gaydos","4.8","4","2","100%","Professor Gaydos is a great guy to get to know if you are interested in the digital forensics field, or even criminal justice in general. The material that I was able to take away from his real life examples was great. You get real material not just the classical textbook terminology and examples. He cares about you getting something from his class"
"Michael Rosano","3.8","3","4.4","100%","Professor Rosano is very knowledgeable on the topics of Justice. I found myself excited to come to class to ponder the great questions of life. You will hone your writing skills but it is worth it. I wanted to come to college to learn something and professor Rosano facilitated that process."
"Beth DeFigueiredo","2.7","7","4","67%","Every classquiz. Hard to keep everything straight between the text, online articles, links, handouts & videos each wk. You can only make up one quiz and if your absent you have to notify as to the reason so she can determine if it's an "acceptable" excused absence. KNOW YOUR ACRONYMS.

"Pamela Walker","5","4","2","100%","I loved her! She turned my passions into a minor!"
"Bogdan Capatina","1.4","4","4.5","0%","Should not be teaching this class because he does not appear to understand the material. Prepare to find some good YouTube videos of instructors that understand the material. Test contains material not discussed in class. No breaks. About as interesting as a watching paint dry."
"Robert Lupton","1.5","2","3","N/A","Grades ruthlessly on exams even when you quote from the textbook. Never responds to emails concerning the research paper. Gives you poor sources for the research essay. Expects you to write pages about a definition on the exam. Avoid the trouble."
"Christine Azzi","4.9","10","1.5","100%","Professor Azzi is the best Arabic teacher, especially if you are not familiar with the language. If you need Arabic, take this professor."
"Jisu Han","4.9","4","1.8","N/A","Great online class. Sends email weekly for reminders of what to do. Each week a short five question quiz, short writing assignment, reading and discussion. One exam at the end but study guide given. Very helpful and emailed me when she couldn't open an assignment I sent and waited until I resent it."
"Celestine Aguwa","2.8","3","3","N/A","Aguwa was rude & inconsiderate. He would call on anyone who didn't seem to be paying attention & make you feel stupid. I hated going to his class bc I knew I would leave with no gained knowledge of the material. I would have rather sat in the back of the class reading the book myself bc all he did was read from slides that weren't even his."
"Karen Pikula","5","1","2","N/A","She was extremely nice and outgoing! She's loves math and always offers to stay after for those who need it! Class was easy. All homework is online, textbook is NOT NEEDED! I really recommend her no matter how well you are in math!"
"William Clarkson","4.8","20","2.6","93%","Really nice professor and very easy class. 3 exams, just study and you will be fine. He gives great study guides and practice tests for it. His grading scale is very generous (87% is an A). His lectures are very boring, i found it very hard to pay attention. Other than that great class and great professor."
"Shazia Khan","4.8","2","2","100%","She's nice. I took her for an internship course, she placed me in an internship that was relevant to my career, 104 hours of attending the internship was required for the whole semester which is around 8 hours a week. Weekly memos writing about the internship, 2 papers for the whole semester. Super easy and possibly beneficial."
"Alexander Poniatowski","4.1","6","3.7","N/A","The people saying this class was easy must be the same students who got a 5 on the AP and should have started in orgo instead. This class was a ton of work and the only reason I was able to do well was all of the extra office hours Dr. P held."
"Marouane Kessentini","4.7","5","1.8","100%","Very reasonable, not too hard, just make sure to go over his lecture slides before the exam. Take your group project seriously because it can be a lot of work if one of your group members doesn't participate. Pretty cool class overall."
"Mark Muscat","4.4","7","3","75%","Mark is a great guy, likes to make jokes. He thinks he's the weatherman. His class is a lot of fun if you participate in the lecture. You do need to keep up with his lecture and take notes. There are a few exams that are all from the notes. He does applications in each class which is where you write about the lecture or your discussion. Easy A"
"Patrick Lynch","3.6","9","3.5","100%","good"
"Mohamed Wiem Mkaouer","4.6","16","2.2","50%","Fun guy outside class, but poor professor... He thinks that because he's brilliant and knows the material he's teaching that we should automatically understand the moment he gives us the information without much explanation. Unfair skewing of online vs in student quizzes; online students have access to internet instead of closed book like in class."
"Joe Nicholas","N/A","","N/A","N/A",""
"Stephanie Wideman","4","3","2.3","N/A","She gives the option of either 12 quizes and 4 speeches or 4 tests and two speeches. She will drop two of your worst quizzes. Shes a great teacher and funny sometimes. I would suggest her."
"Krisanu Bandyopadhyay","4.4","17","2.8","100%","Dr. B really cares about his students. His class is very lecture-based and he goes kinda fast so make sure you are paying attention. His exams are very similar to the practice exam and he will repeat questions from recitation sheets."
"Lindsey Jamula","5","2","1.5","N/A","Best professor ever.  I was very scared of taking Orgo Lab, but with her, it's a different ballgame.  She's the nicest professor I've ever had, and she's a very fair grader.  She's really good at teaching Orgo. She'll  answer any questions you have.  Exams are straight forward.  As with any class, if you try and put in the work, you will do great."
"Mohana Macanty","5","1","1","N/A","Great teacher"
"Francine Banner","4.8","14","2.8","100%","I loved Professor Banner's class; one of the best professors I've had so far. She cares a lot about her students and was always very flexible/fair with due dates and grading. There are 2 papers, 2 exams, and 1 group project. Attendance isn't necessarily mandatory, but is worth it for the class discussion & a better understanding of the material."
"Carrie Swift","5","1","3","100%","When I first signed up for this class I was terrified bc of the reviews. However, this is one of the most interesting and forgiving classes I have taken.

"Rubin Luniku","4.5","6","2.7","100%","He was a really funny professor and very caring. His tests can be a little difficult if you don't use the book but the quizzes are fairly easy. Occasionally his lecturing can get dry but then he'll usually crack a joke to help lighten the material."
"Omid Dehzangi","2.4","4","4.5","100%","Lectures were sometimes hard to understand, but there was always an opportunity to ask for clarification. What really set the class apart for me was professor Dehzangi's willingness to take time outside of class to help students. I took his class as an undergrad and he meet with me weekly to make sure that I understood everything fully."
"Vincent Wright","3","2","3","100%","Professor Wright taught an amazing class and I really enjoyed being a part of it. The class can be a little boring from time to time, but was overall very stimulating and we held great class discussions."

I hope to take another class with her!"
"David Kaufman","3.5","14","4.3","72%","Lectures are VERY dry and typically last the entire slot time. Test questions are nothing like the problems in the book so make sure you do the practice exams he provides. He also gives solutions to all homework, so if you have any difficulty, just look at that before submitting. The extra-credit & curving saved my grade."

"Anda Botoseneanu","3.3","8","3.9","75%","She is the toughest professor I ever had!!! She knows her subjects well and lectures well. BUT she expects you to come to every single one of her lectures and if you miss a lecture or quiz she will NOT let you make it up even if you have a doctors note. She is a tough tough grader and expects you to know everything about the subject.DONT TAKE HER!!"
"Therese Shaw","3.8","6","3","50%","My all-time favorite professor at U of M Dearborn. Prof. Shaw was incredibly knowledgeable and loved to share that knowledge with her students. She was very interesting and even went so far as to take a break from long lectures by reading excerpts from greek epics. She helped my classmates start a classic languages club and was always available."
"Christopher Piechocki","1.5","1","5","N/A","Prof Pieochocki is a mentee to Dr. Awad. All of Pieochocki's teaching material is from Dr. Awad's material so it would be a direct copy and past. The problem with that is, if you had any questions, he would refer you to read the material without really knowing how to answer the question. Exams are NOT comparable to lecture notes nor study guide!"
"Beth Hendershot","5","4","2","100%","Shes a very kind professor. Her class was very lecture heavy and the few grades you received were tests or a project, but as long as you work hard on those, youll do good. Shes a great professor and person."

"Mark  Salvatore","3.6","10","4","100%","Makes the class entertaining. Each class has clicker questions, which are easy points. Exams were not difficult. There are many homework assignments, but, again, not difficult. Can be a tough grader, but always willing to help if you have any questions."

"Brian  Zahra","4.3","2","2","N/A","Definitely one of the smartest and most incisive teachers I have ever had throughout my learning career.  He is very clear and expects you to read and know the material.  He explains thing in ways that actually help you understand, unlike most professors who are just plain condescending!  His background and his knowledge are a great addition U OF M"
"Harry Derderian","3","1","3","0%","Professor Derderian is a very nice man. I wouldn't say he is a very good professor, though. I had a 3 hour class with him that never ran over an hour because he would just read the powerpoints word for word and send us home 2 hours early every week. That was nice and all but I didn't really learn ANYTHING from him and that made exams difficult."

He explains the material and breaks it down to where one can understand"

"Nadine Anderson","5","1","4","100%","I learned so much about research in this online class . If you really want to learn how to properly research take this class.

"Anne Tyszka","4.3","6","2.3","84%","The online class was super easy and educative! Every week, there was a discussion that you had to engage with other colleagues. As long as you did the homework and assignments, you were good! I loved this class because it was very enlightening and easy to follow. Indeed, one of the best professors I've ever had!"
"Gevorg Stepanyan","1.7","6","3.3","17%","This professor was always late to class about 15 minutes (for an hour and 15 minute course). He would come running into class like he just ran a marathon and go on a tangent before actually starting lecture. He is extremely in-concise and altogether intolerable when asking any questions, often criticizing you for not understanding him. He's useless"
"Calvin McMillin","3.8","7","3.2","72%","Honestly, I did not know anything about creative writing. I learned how to write short stories after taking this class. Learned that a short story should have a surprising ending. Also, we had 3 short stories and Final Portfolio. Workshops are so much helpful. If you love writing and want to write better , take this class."
"Geraldine Pappas","4","3","3.7","67%","I am so happy that I got the honor to meet Dr. Pappas and to learn a lot from her. You'll learn way beyond the textbook in her class. She is a difference maker! She is very knowledgeable!  Her feedback is amazing and her lectures are very inspiring. Honestly, I wish she teaches all ESLreading courses to get the opportunity to learn more from her."
"Jessica Camp","4.8","6","2.3","100%","I really loved Professor Camp. The university is very lucky to have her teaching here and I enjoyed her class so much. She will stay after class for as long as you need (she stayed over an hour after class to help me) until you get tour work done and fully understand it. She tells you exactly what to do to get an A and helps you get there."
"Alex Ketchum","3.4","5","4","40%","The worst lab professor I have ever had. He is condescending and barely helps students with the labs. His lab quizzes are hard and correlate with reading from the textbook rather the lab book. He takes forever to grade and does not leave feedback for why things are wrong. My semester is over and I only have 6/11 labs graded/returned."

"Anis Drira","2","1","3","0%","His writing in the lectures was so fast that he rarely explained what he was doing. I took the class online, so I was able to pause, but if I was in class, I would have probably missed a ton of notes. Poor communication. Delayed assignments at last moment. Were not even sure if we would have an exam, until a few days before."
"Neal Morton","3.8","4","3.5","50%","He is a really good lecturer. His examples to his topics are spot on and hes a likeable guy. HOWEVER, his tests are extremely difficult. Consist of multiple choice, t/f & short answer. Will have 5 short answer questions and each youll need to list & explain a 6 step scenario. It was really tricky unless you memorize the entire book."
"Kendra Anspaugh","4.3","4","3.5","100%","Hand down best professor, Love you Kendra!!"
"Mohamed Abouelenien","5","4","3.8","100%","Literally the best Data Science Professor on the campus. He helps you to learn more about the space more than anyone and loves to teach about it! His projects and assignments are real world applicable projects that help you to see what the industry is like. When it came to exams they were straight forward and his reviews for them are amazing!"
"Emily Wilson","4","1","2","100%","She's gorgeous!!! Shes a really good professor and she was my lab instructor. Shes very sweet, and straight forward. Pay attention, do the work and you'll have an A. Did I mention how attractive she is?!"
"Basem Alwan","3","1","4","100%","I had Dr. Basem at Baker College in Allen Park for Chemistry. Hes a great teacher well respected. If you are struggling with Chemistry, he will be there to help you.

"Jonathan Smith","2.5","2","4.5","50%","It's 2020, and this man is easily the worst prof to take on online class with. I'd rather die than take an online class with him. His instructions are 2-3 pages in length, and are often unclear. If you assume, then he will grade you rough, because you didn't ask. Took a class with him before, but I know for a fact that I didn't want to take another"
"Richard Consul","N/A","","N/A","N/A",""
"Richard Johnson","5","5","1","100%","This professor was very nice and respectful. I took Professor Johnson for CRJ 469 and I would highly recommend him to anyone considering his class. There were weekly quizzes based on the material for the course, as long as you read the chapter/article for the week you would breeze through the quiz. Professor gave you 2 chances on quizzes as well."
"Karen Shaper","3.9","10","2.6","60%","Karen is a wonderful instructor. She grades progressively, meaning it's all building up to something and each speech needs to be better than the last. This is a great class and I enjoyed the family like atmosphere that made me want to attend. But the book, don't buy the book, it's up to you, but I used it and I will use it in the future."
"Matthew Hayes","4.1","7","3.5","72%","Professor Hayes is awesome! He understands that passing an exam doesn't equal learning the material. His tests for this class are "take home" and he is a reasonable grader. He also has worked in the industry so he knows what you need to learn and what you can skip. Highly recommend."
"William McMillian","4.5","2","1.5","100%","Bill is a great professor and is also a good resource for students in journalism (especially sports). The class is easy, but the range of assignments we did expose you to all aspects and types of sports writing. A must take if you are interested in sports writing! We had the opportunity to sit in the press box at a U-M football game too!"
"Rusi Sun","3","2","4","50%","This was one of the best online courses I've taken at Dearborn. I learned a lot from the readings, discussion posts, and lecture materials.

"Amy Keesling","5","2","1","100%","Class was really easy but didn't learn much. Five projects, none of which are hard. You write two short reports about topics in your field, write a business letter, write a resume, write some instructions, etc. She's lenient when it comes to grading and your allowed to resubmit to get some points back. She's a good person to take it with."
"Navid Rahbariasr","5","2","3","100%","He is amazing I highly recommend taking his class! Very knowledgeable and keeps the material interesting. He explains very well in class and solves a lot of problems that are similar to those on the HW and exams. He does not make you feel bad if you asked a silly question and makes sure to go back and reexplain it. Never got bored in his lectures!"
"John Taylor","5","4","2.4","100%","He is a nice and understanding prof. He won't mark you down on late submission. Grades well and gives nice feedback. The course load is very less, probably will be the easiest class you can take. All in all take him."
"Tarek Lahdhiri","3.5","2","4.5","50%","I have never had a professor who seemed as genuinely interested in making sure that everyone understood the material he was teaching. Not only is he extremely knowledgeable in the topics, but he is a great teacher. The material in this course is very difficult but if you participate and ask questions, he will explain anything you need. Fair grader."
"Jing Stimpson","5","2","3","100%","When I first started this class, I thought learning Chinese would be so difficult. And in the beginning, it was! However, Prof. Jing Stimpson was very helpful and patient throughtout the way. Her classes are small which gives more one on one time to help you improve. Her lectures are very well explained and thought out. Would definitely recommend!"

"Youngki Kim","4.5","4","4.3","75%","Professor Kim is an amazing teacher for online courses. Works through complex topics very clearly & uses tech for remote teaching very well. He makes online OH very effective by utilizing the digital white board. Workload is NOT light but he teaches engaging, relevant topics and it is worth the extra effort. I have tried to take all his classes!"
"Stephen Bazinski","4","1","3","100%","Learned a decent amount in this class, not very hard (typical workload). You still need to study the material, otherwise he will surprise you with some questions. If you put in the effort, you will receive a good grade."

"P.F. Potvin","3.9","14","3.5","89%","The only bad thing that I can say about professor Potvin is that there is a decent amount of work throughout the semester, which switches between a lot of reading or a lot of writing. On the other hand, he is flexible with deadlines, very enthusiastic (meaning lectures are never boring), and cares about his students growth."
"Ashley Oteney","5","4","1.3","100%","Very manageable and easy course, and she made it that way. She is a great teacher, just follow instructions you're guaranteed an A. Exams are based on her PowerPoint lectures they're very short lectures just download them.

Graded assignments two days after class ended!"

"Ghassan Abou-Zeineddine","2.8","8","3.7","25%","Nice guy, but he grades as if hes assessing a thesis. Pretty sure the highest grade in the class was a B, which isnt bad but when there isnt one A in the class, there is something wrong with the professor. He gets ahead of himself a lot and ends up confusing the students and himself. Be prepared for corny puns/jokes and awkward eye contact."

"Zhi Zhang","5","11","2.5","100%","Professor Zhang is one of the EASIEST professors I have ever taken. You can tell she cares about the wellbeing of her students and whether or not they are learning.

"Atanu Bhattacharya","1.3","13","2.7","8%","He really never taught anything, as everything is on McGraw hill. Study assignments on McGraw hill are for participation points if you dont attend lecture. 2 assignments that are very hard but short which oddly tank your grade. You can get As on your exams, and still get a B in the class bc of the assignments. Just a very weird grading scale."
"Robert Ridgeway","3.8","5","2.4","40%","Professor Ridgway was extremely disorganized and did ran lectures long past the scheduled end time. Group tasks made the class harder than it had to be as the individual assignments were relatively easy. Only take if no other professors are available"
"Rhonda Ross","3.5","6","1.3","100%","Had Prof Ross this past winter for Corp Social Responsibility. Her lectures were basically just useless personal rants. The class was a disorganized mess; she cancelled multiple quizzes because she "forgot" them (but gave us all 100%). The quizzes are all easy definitions from the textbook. If you just ignore her and read the book, it's an easy A."
"Feng Zhou","2.9","4","3.8","50%","Pretty tough grader, not the type of guy to give a full 100% on important assignments regardless of how well you do, this class the group project and project milestones are the biggest part of your grade, lots of reading!"
"Patricia Wren","4.6","8","3.1","100%","AMAZING PROFESSOR! Her lectures are extremely interesting and if you memorize her slides you will ace her class, but she only provides the slides in class, so attend and take pictures. Be careful of essays, edit a lot. Go to office hours and get to know her, she is a professor that you want to know beyond her role as a lecturer."
"Erik Marshall","3.7","31","2","65%","This was a really easy class. If you want a class that can give you an easy A, I would highly recommend this professor! Just keep in mind, that you will have to participate in a lot of discussions, and do some essays."
"Paul Richardson","3.1","14","3.4","0%","Your grade will be fine, but if you can, take SD with someone else. He is the stereotypical middle aged jerk engineering manager. Makes assumptions and doesn't apologize when he is wrong. Discourages learning and asking questions, tells you you're not a real engineer if there's something you don't know off the top of your head. Putty was better."
"Gengxin Li","4.5","8","1.8","100%","Literally the easiest class ever with her, you would only not get an A if you are trying not to, I would take every class with her.

"Justin Peer","4.4","75","2.4","85%","The kindest professor at UMD. Had him for psych 455 and psych 101, and his structure is very consistent. He has clear expectations, follows the syllabus, and doesn't give tough/unfair exams. 4 tests and 2 papers, and his feedback on them is very thorough. You can tell he cares a lot for the subject and the students. Highly recommend taking him."
"Jaehwan Choi","2.4","27","2.8","47%","Don't listen to the bad reviews, he's such a nice guy. There was no final and quizzes were online and mostly like the PowerPoints, two of the quizzes had math involved so I screwed up those ones, If I didn't, I would've got an A. He made me laugh in his lectures and I wouldn't listen to the bad reviews at all."

"Brahim Medjahed","4.3","26","3","86%","Capstone course so a lot of software engineering work. Worked with students to keep everyone from combusting. Extremely understanding and accommodating.

"Paul Hughes","3.9","67","3","67%","he was rude to me when i tried to have a conversation with him after class about a topic from lecture. he told me he was too busy to watch a youtube video i recommended on the subject. I asked him how long until he would be able to watch it he said at least 6 months. I was a just an excited freshman and that was really discouraging and RUDE"

"Joe Lunn","3.7","52","2.6","88%","Genuinely one of the nicest professors I've met. His classes are a lot of reading, so if you want an easy class you should probably look elsewhere. If you don't mind reading and participating in discussions, I can't recommend him enough!"
"James Nissen","4.8","7","2.6","100%","The professor is nice, but the pacing of his class assumes you have no other classes/outside responsibilities to manage. Unreasonable for an online asynchronous course. You'll need time to cram all of your week's readings at once, since the deadlines for discussions and quizzes on them are staggered in a way that's very difficult to keep up with."
"Patricia Smith","3.4","8","3.3","75%","Prof Smith was someone who I was skeptical of taking but her class is pretty straight forward. Since we are online it was a bit different. Quiz ever week, opened Thursday and closed on Sunday, then a homework assignment every 2 weeks or so. Exams were pretty tricky due to specific wording she was looking for(you'd get marked down a few points)"
"Timothy Hartage","4.3","4","2.3","100%","Out of all the classes in semester, professor Timothy's class holds the crown. I've had him more then once and he is absolutely amazing and just an all around great class that he teaches.

"Jun He","3.5","23","2.3","50%","There are only 'quizzes' & the final exam. Quizzes are just an assignment that you can access more than once & take your time on. You get 3 attempts & you keep your highest score. Says you get a fresh set of questions each attempt but they are the same or similar each time. Gave us extra credit & ended up slightly curving our final grades."

Though she is a tough grader, she provides amazing feedback that will help you improve quickly."

"Tom Deska","4.7","18","2.3","82%","Weekly assignments; half via Canvas and the other half written. Tests are very easy and are right off his PPT slides. He is slow to respond to emails but other than that he's great. Class is an easy A if you pay attention."
"Jeff Igo","3.9","113","3.8","63%","Professor Jeff Igo is the best Math teacher out here in UMICH Dearborn. I am in calc 2 rn and I wish I had him because of the way he taught his materials. He gives all the possible examples for problems that you may face and it is just very helpful. He goes step by step. I never had to watch a Youtube Video but now I have to in my calc 2."
"Pamela Aronson","4.1","60","3.4","70%","Do not take her!  My grade dropped from an A to a C. She demonstrates a biased grading approach and lacks empathy towards extenuating circumstances."

She makes it almost impossible for any student to fail her course since it is organized quite meticulously. My only piece of advice (for you) is to do the reading and look over the corresponding notes and you will do fine."
"Roger Loeb","3","53","4","42%","Very eccentric, but he knows his psych! Textbook is a must-have as the class is basically 10 written assignments. Very picky on grading, he is all about conciseness. I sorta resent the fact that your grade is based on HIS assignments, rather than internship performance. However, there are lots of varying internships available."
"Jane O'Connell-Devlin","2.1","5","4.3","20%","I took her during the Winter 2022 semester. She was alright, biggest complaint was that some of the labs were too long; however, she does not write the labs. One thing I did dislike is that participation was graded out of 5. Showing up is a 4, but you need to answer questions for the last point and sometimes she gave no questions to answer."
"Michael Putty","5","8","3","100%","A real gem! Take as many classes as you can with him. He cares about students (academic & personal) and always avail outside of class for questions. He is really good at explaining things when you have questions, and doesn't just give away As. You actually learn in his class, and it's not as painful as most other classes. I took 3-4 classes w/ him"
"Claudia Walters","3.4","49","4","64%","I took her foundations class so it might be a bit different from others she teaches. I thought she was an extremely fair and forgiving grader, I found the exams easy because even though it was short answer, it was all from the powerpoint. She is also more than happy to help with anything you're stuck on. Hope to have her for more classes."
"Wencong SU","2.2","11","3.5","34%","He doesn't curve and exams had a low average. Be prepared to seek help from others or look online for homework. The recitation sessions weren't that helpful. Labs and lectures weren't in sync for the first two months. I think it would be best to learn from scheduling office hours. Some homework questions are very similar to exam questions."
"Kalyan Kondapalli","4","29","3.9","89%","You should know your basics from cell bio classes or else you will not do well. This is a capstone class and you will need to apply what you learn. Tests are open book but not easy. He cares about students. Meet with him if you are having trouble.  He curves in the end so do not give up. I learnt a lot from this class that is actually useful."
"Dan Swift","3.9","59","3.4","50%","Dr. Swift is a nice person. However just because he's nice does not mean he knows how to teach. Taking this course, I felt like I had to have has a Ph.D. in statistics. If it's not obvious, I'm an undergrad. His tests were so hard the class average was 20. For both midterm and final. I don't recommend taking him at all."
"Robert Hymes","5","147","3.8","75%","Prof seems nice but goes off on tangents a lot. he is also old school all the way with chalkboard lectures and no powerpoint. not having powerpoints to study from is frustrating to say the least. It's 2023, get with the technology!"
"Aditya vikram Viswanathan","4.6","11","3.1","91%","He is very very good at delivering the course material. Just pay attention during lectures and make sure to understand them and the rest should not be a problem. If you do not understand something, ask him right away and he always explains them to you. A fun class to take if you like math."
"Luis Sanchez-Perez","2.7","25","4.2","44%","Doesn't do a good job teaching the material. I went into this class having no knowledge in coding and I left with some basics but it was hard to learn with him. I needed help from other people to actually understand the material. I heard he's good with teaching other topics but coding is not his best. He seems too smart to teach intro-level classes"
"Chris Klein","4.3","43","3.3","82%","I absolutely loved professor Klein, I had him for psych 101 and 320. He does give thorough exams, however, they're on everything he lectures on and some just from the reading so you do have to read the textbook. He is a great lecturer and is good at listing what will be on the tests. This class includes group mandatory participation discussions."
"Mercedes Miranda","2.8","39","4.4","32%","The class is difficult compared to others, but it is laid out well. Midterm and Final are short answers and there's no study guide so you have to study every module. DO NOT fall behind in the weekly modules or you won't be able to catch up. If you have questions or need help Dr. Miranda was very nice and quick to respond to me."
"Joe Musial","4.3","30","2.4","100%","After 9 semesters, Joe Musial has been the best professor I've ever taken at UMD. The class is composed of 4 exams and 1 paper. The exams are easy, just follow his in class notes and you will be good. The paper is based on research that he helps with tremendously during class sessions. Participation is not required, but I recommend it heavily."
"Melissa Bowlin","3.1","46","5","30%","Dr. Bowlin is easily one of my favorite profs. Lectures are funny and easy to understand. Her grading of tests and assignments are more than fair. As someone that almost never studies, my grade in her class grade is my highest, so it's definitely possible to do well. It is an upper level class so you have to put in some effort and earn your grade."
"Michael MacDonald","4.9","31","2.4","93%","Very good and easy. You can tell he likes what he does and knows his stuff."
"Ulrich Kamp","2.6","8","3.5","29%","Dunno how this man has this score. He is pretty blunt though so I can see how that might throw people off and he does grade kind of slow. Overall he's a pretty chill and funny guy, knowledgeable about what he's teaching and has relevant stories. Would recommend."
"Thomas Foy","4.8","13","2.9","93%","Lots of weekly announcements online. Lots of material."
"John Artis","4.7","3","2.7","100%","John Artis is a kind man who just wants to share his knowledge and experience with other students. He's a stickler for participation and discussions. If you come in and simply share your thoughts on whatever he is discussing you should be fine. Papers are simple, grading criteria is clear, grading is generous. A good resource for future references."
"Jeffrey Bouwman","5","27","2.5","100%","Great professor. Very flexible with class schedule and very helpful with the course."
"Elif Bilgin","3.1","22","3.8","100%","Nothing to really warn about her, sometimes she expects a lot, but overall she's pretty helpful and goes out of her way to look out for her student's best interests. I would take her again."
"Rifaat Dika","4.4","29","2.3","100%","He is pretty chill and the class was fun. We also went on a field trip which rocked. There's homework due every class but he grades off effort. Tests are easy if you pay attention and put in the effort. Attendance and participation are mandatory but the class environment is very relaxed."
"John Clifford","3.8","94","3.8","78%","useless lecture copies the textbook onto the board. additionally, textbook exercises have no answers, and he refuses to give them, says they are online despite him never looking. refuses to answer emails, says he gets hundreds, so he says go to office hours. office hours are around 12-1pm, where most people have class. quizzes are ok, exams arent"
"Richard Kent","4.9","11","3.1","82%","Professor Kent does a great job teaching the course. He really does a great job breaking down the material so students can understand it. He uses helpful examples too. Tests are manageable if you come to class and participate and pay attention. He truly wants students to succeed and does everything in his power to help!"
"Emily Luxon","4.6","31","3","87%","If you ever get a chance, TAKE HER!! Best prof at UMD and deserves a raise because of how caring she is (we used clip notes every week to vent out our thoughts and feelings)!! Her assignments and discussions were easy!."
"Grace Kotre","5","6","2","100%","I learned things from this class that I will take with me for the rest of my life. Grace Kotre is a lovely soul. I have never had a prof show the amount of care for their students as she does. This class is what you make of it, and I recommend you make the most because it will benefit you! I'm so glad I took this class. 11/10 recommend"
"Xiaofang Wang","1.9","11","3.8","19%","She is very proactive with students but unfortunately her lectures feel incomplete and she makes mistakes. Homework usually covers more material than the lecture so expect to use the text book and self teach. Overall concepts can be difficult to understand. If you take lecture notes and complete all homework you'll do well b/c open book exams."
"Velimir Stojkovski","5","34","2.6","92%","Genuinely the best professor I've ever had. He also gave the most captivating lectures I've ever experienced. There's only 4 grades (attendance and 3 essay exams) but they're easy if you take notes on his lectures. He's easygoing and really cares about ensuring everyone learns the concepts."
"Rachel Pricer","4.8","3","3","100%","This professor is one of the kindest and most understanding professors at this university. She is very knowledgeable! This class consists of 4-5 exams and a few HW assignments. The questions are straightforward and if you pay attention in class you can pass with an A. The book was not needed but it helps solidify the information. Don't miss class!"
"Gail Wilson","4","6","3","80%","The class was very straightforward, and the assignments and grading criteria were clear. I would take Prof. Wilson again for a class if given the chance."
"Tuere Wheeler","4.8","14","1.8","100%","Willing to help you with whatever you need. Gives a lot of advice about the work force that will help you in the future."
"Adnan Shaout","3.1","73","4.3","20%","Grading based on 2 exams and a project, along with a couple of presentations/reports on published papers about fuzzy logic.  Course material comes entirely out of lectures, which are incredibly dense, and he moves very fast through them.  Incredibly easy to fall behind.  Exams are tough so he grades on a curve."
"ZhongXu Liu","4","23","3.9","73%","Class is very straightforward. The lectures are detailed and just like the textbook chapters. There are weekly quizzes and discussions which are very easy if you watch the lecture videos. There is a final research paper to work on throughout the sem. Its really not that bad so do it early to get it out of the way. Nice and caring professor."
"Hussein Farhat","3.9","5","3.6","80%","Amazing professor! Helped out whenever possible and graded fairly. He is a joy to talk too and a great person!"
"Francine Dolins","3.6","53","4.1","62%","Not a fan."
"Aaron Ahuvia","3.8","38","2.9","100%","As a professor, he's highly respected and knowledgeable in marketing. However, I did not really like the model of his class, basically 2 exams and one final project. I definitely did not like the model he had in place for completing the project week to week. There would be too many class gaps and at times we would lose track of where we left off."
"Amy Broman","4.3","27","2.5","84%","The class is slightly difficult because of the material. It is really important to read the book and practice cases to help you on her exams. Class is based off discussion boards, a paper, 1 assignment and 3 exams. Her exams are a little difficult if you don't understand HOW the material is applied to different cases. Everything else is easy."
"Tim Hartge","2.9","77","3","47%","In the beginning of the course he made it clear that participation was important. He would give out sticky notes to everyone who participated during the class period and collect them at the end. I made sure that I said something every class. Once it came down to final grades, he said that my participation was 25% (i never missed class either)."
"Gerald Holowicki","3.6","86","3.4","48%","You will learn so much in this class. Great teacher!"
"Philipp Rauschnabel","4.1","36","2.6","93%","Best Prof! Lots of examples, interesting guest speakers. Gives good feedback on projects. Would take again."
"William Noakes","4.9","12","1.3","100%","Literally writing this rating in his class rn. for reals the best. Super chill, one easy midterm. he's not traditional. no final test, its a class project. just show up and listen to the very nice and funny guy. no stress, he just wants everyone to learn howto work as a team. for real the easiest class i have ever taken in my entire life. TAKE HIM"
"Michele Yoder","4.4","5","3.4","100%","Very good professor, excellent lecturer, and gave very clear direction on what she expected. There were only two papers, but they were long and required many hours of work to get a good grade. She is a very hard grader, so many people did not do well on them. This is not a blow-off class and you must put in the work to get an A."
"John Lewis","1.6","64","4.4","N/A","Jumps all over the place and clearly HE gets it but has a very hard time explaining it, he tries to help but doesn't very well.  Oh and on Mondays he's all calm and the rest of the week is bouncing off the walls.  Pot on the weekends the coffee and cigarettes during the week I guess?  Try for Strowe he's a much better instructor."
"Sharon Werner","4.7","17","1.4","84%","Great professor, great feedback and explains upcoming assignments thoroughly. Also has group assignments."
"Karen Strandholm","3.5","34","3.6","34%","This teacher does not care about students. This is a typical revenue generating busy work class. Show up, do the busy work, pay them money for a useless college credit."
"Aurora Harris","4.1","52","3.3","73%","She gave long, unnecessary discussion boards, and you pretty much learn nothing. Her instructions are unclear, and when you ask for help, she explains the work, which is still unclear. She ends up talking about stuff that doesn't pertain to the assignments. I would only retake her if I had to. However, I will continue to avoid her at all costs."
"Liana McMillan","3.9","47","3.1","67%","I took Frau McMillan for my German 101 course. She was fabulous as a person, and I liked her as professor. She is not unfortunately, a great professor to take if you have any kind of need for a slightly slower pace for homework and assignments. I couldn't keep up with the pace of the class and unfortunately dropped this course."
"Amal Yagub","3","2","3","50%","One of the best professors Ive had. Helps you understand material and makes it easy to comprehend all the information thrown at us."
"Christine Stewart","N/A","","N/A","N/A",""
"Hafiz Malik","3.4","20","3.6","60%","Tries to frame himself as a reasonable man but grades incredibly harshly. He once said he understands students work and go to school but has assigned 3 quizzes in a week twice now. He said and I quote "This exam is easy and most of you will finish in 30 minutes." Not a single student finished in an hour and 15 minutes. Avoid if possible."
"Xi Chen","3.4","6","4.3","40%","She was good and very helpful. I asked a lot of questions about the homework and she replied in time. But actually, this course is useless to me. Our schedule system is way much better than the textbook taught."
"Reem Omer","N/A","","N/A","N/A",""
"Nilay Chakraborty","4.1","9","3.4","75%","Professor is the most communicative teacher I've had in my 3 years at U of M Dearborn. He is so open to questions and emails, never makes you feel like you're bothering him. Super nice. He's also a great grader, lenient, open textbook exams. Lecture is online, tests and labs in person. Really wants you to learn about bioprocessing. Passionate!"
"Gregory Osowski","4","8","2.6","75%","I took him for my internship. He's the type of professor that loves to put students on the spot. His class really did cause me so much anxiety. I'm glad that I took it during corona because if I had to experience it in a normal setting, I know I wouldn't have been able to. He says you're safe to say your opinion but know that is not the case."
"Faisal Khalaf","3.1","7","3.8","60%","As a Quality professional with a Mstrs. Deg. in Quality already, I took this course as a core requirement for my second Masters in Mfg. Eng. I would never associate my name with his level of work or performance. He did not embrace quality principles and did not give students the tools or resources to be successful. I do not recommend at all."
"Michael Bohanon","3.9","8","2.4","88%","Bohanon is a great teacher. He goes out of his way to make sure you understand ISM. He posts weekly tutorials showing you how to do activities. He will also make time to go over any issues you are having and will walk you through the work. Weekly quizzes, weekly HW, group project at end of semester, and a final exam. He's fair with his grading."
"Nancy Kursman","4.3","50","2.6","85%","PLEASE BE AWARE: The CRJ/POL 300 class is a STATISTICS class. I have no idea how it's labeled as CRJ/POL, it is very misleading and a lot of people were fooled. Again, it is a statistics class. You must attend the online zoom meeting because at the very end you will be given an attendance grade. Nice teacher, you can talk to her about anything."
"David Yoon","3","74","3.3","40%","Dr. Yoon is great. Take him if you get the chance. His lessons are in my subconscious. When I have to reuse the material in new classes I find myself able to recall it surprisingly easily! His class starts out deceivingly simple. The difficulty builds, keep up with the lessons and you'll be ok. All projects & tests are examples in the book/slides."
"Shridhar Lakshmanan","2.7","25","3.1","50%","Class consists of 3 quizzes and 2 projects. Lectures do not adequately prepare you for projects. Recommended to have an extensive Matlab background before taking this. Doesn't connect what he's lecturing and how to apply it to problems. Yet he curves HEAVILY. Just an odd class."
"Marie Waung","4.5","78","3","80%","this course is just social psych again so it felt like a big waste of time and money. no need for textbook since her lectures are all from the book. Having only 1 min/question on quizzes increased my test anxiety and effected my quiz grades. discussions were easy busywork and paper was pretty easy too."
"Mark Steffka","4","20","3","100%","Mark Steffka is the absolute best His incredibly warm & funny teaching style made me attend every lecture (most classes I just watch the recordings). Non engineering friends & family would come across me watching lecture (Zoom) and get drawn in, enjoy the teaching, and learn a bit. Wish he taught more classes. Biggest downside was canvas quizzes."
"Nicholas Vlisides","4","47","3.8","82%","The professor is nice and funny; however, he has little patience. He makes students feel like their questions are stupid a lot of the time. I feel uncomfortable asking him questions because he often has an attitude. I like him as a person but the class is difficult. The way he teaches be 401 is harder than the other professors."
"Camron Amin","3.5","51","3.3","67%","Please do not take this class even if your life depends on it. You will spend more time looking at references than actually learning the material. I took this class online and for the work I had to put out for it was insane. He assigns work as if we have nothing else better to do other than his class. The class was also extremely unorganized."
"Ara Sanjian","3","24","3.5","67%","I took this course in the summer. He assigned weekly discussion boards and biweekly 750-word essays. Which are easy. My concern was that he has no rubric or any sort of exception for how he wants the assignment to be completed. Therefore, he gave 7-8s for everything with zero feedback. When emailed, he is kind and respectful.."
"Marija Andrijonas","3","29","3.3","40%","The best professor I've ever taken. One of the very very few teachers that wants to see her students succeed. Highly recommend taking Professor Andrijonas."
"Angela Capuano","3.8","3","3.8","67%","Dr. Capuano is an exemplary educator, demonstrating genuine care and kindness towards her students. Her lectures are captivating, showcasing her exceptional competence and expertise in the field of ABA. The grading system is straightforward. She sprinkles occasional jokes during lectures. She actively seeks to ensure her students grasp the material"
"Kim Killu","3","31","4.3","50%","Dr. Killu displayed competence, although my recollection of the specific course content is somewhat limited. Nevertheless, the course's unique setup proved to be remarkably engaging, as it emphasized practical application. This approach not only fostered an enjoyable learning experience but also honed my public speaking skills significantly."
"Xiang Weidong","2.2","17","2.2","15%","Lectures are usually rambling messes that don't portray what you are supposed to learn that isn't helped at all by his HEAVY accent. Very few examples. The homework isn't a good reflection of the lectures and the lecture slides barely help. The one positive is that tests are very similar to homework and he grades tests leniently."
"Yunus Zeytuncu","4.8","43","2.9","100%","Finishing my last semester now and looking back, this was the best professor I ever had. He took a subject that was supposedly very difficult and made it as easy to understand as possible. He was always available to speak after class and in his office and was always helpful whenever needed. As long as you're willing to pay attention, you'll be fine"
"Kyungwon Lee","3.5","7","3","100%","Avoid if possible. I would wait until they find a new person to teach this class."
"Steven Murrell","5","9","2.1","100%","homework every week but it is all on chegg. Tests were hard but i also didn't try and never prepared. got a 77% on both. Drops lowest homework and quiz at end of semester. Easy science credit for someone looking for that. Take HHS 100 as a science credit before this tho. way easier"
"John Cerne","4.8","4","3.3","100%","Had a small, simple class with Professor Cerne. He is knowledgeable, extremely flexible and wants to help students in their career path. Most learning was through IAB material and real-world concepts. Downsides came with an unstructured course layout and some unorganized content from the professor. Overall a cool guy and very easy course."
"Selim Awad","3.6","31","4","46%","Nice guy, but is absolutely brutal. I tend to be the guy who just looks at professor ratings before each semester and that's it. But I came out of my way to actually write a review about him. Very hard to reach, difficult to understand and read notes, and difficult tests. Overall, if you can avoid him you definitely should. Your GPA will thank you."
"Michael Vanhemert","2.9","46","4","42%","MVH will take a simple statement and turn it into a dissertation. I've spent more time trying to interpret his directions than actually doing the assignments. It seems like he's going out of his way to sound pretentious. Exams were also a race against time. I've never experienced such a high level of stress trying to finish an exam."
"Justin Ames","4.9","15","2.9","93%","Professor Ames is a very good lecturer and is very clear in what he expects in his assignments. There is one group project you work on throughout the entire semester and there are 2 individual assignments. There is an optional final as long as the entire class participates in the discussions during class. He is one of the best professors here."
"Di Ma","4","12","2.5","86%","She's a very nice and caring professor. I would recommend her."
"Lashorage Shaffer","2.6","10","3.1","40%","worst professor ever. does not respond to emails makes u redo assignments over and over and awful communication"
"Imad Makki","1","1","3","0%","This professor is the worst intructor that I have taken in this school. He says that he is fair and consistent when grading while he isn't. His expectations are consistently changing that when the exam comes your odds of winning the lottery first try are higher than you knowing how he wants you to work. Catchphrase: "As you have seen in undergrad""
"Sarah Deward","4.8","20","2.9","95%","Prof. DeWard is so sweet! Even though I took this class asynchronously, she still wanted to get to know the students in the class. She gives great feedback on all of your assignments. Each week, there's a decent amount of reading (probably 2-3 hours worth) a quiz, and usually either a reflection or discussion. Easy A if you put in the work."
"Tony Luckett","5","28","1.6","100%","I loved this teacher. I took a screen studies class with him completely online two years before and he was fantastic and gave great feedback that helped me be better. He was the exact same way when I took a hybrid class with him for Black Cinema. He made everything interesting and his discussions were always fun. He truly is the best."
"Mouhanad Hammami","4.7","8","1.5","100%","One of the few professors who makes getting a good grade easy, and does not arbitrarily decide to grade an entry-level class as if it's upper level. Weekly lectures but you can realistically pass without even watching them. Open-book exams too. Can't recommend him enough. Even if you don't need the class just take it as an elective credit."
"Brenda Whitehead","3.5","32","3.6","67%","Professor Whitehead is a very kind but her class work is not it sis. There is so much reading and papers, I constantly wanted to set the book on fire. The final is very difficult, my study guide was 17 pages long. In order to do well you pretty much need to memorize the textbook. Overall she is a nice, it can be helpful to meet with her."
"Junaid Farooq","4","2","3","50%","Takes forever to give feedback on work. Had a midterm progress report (ungraded) to show him the work we had done for the final paper up to that point (nearly a month before the final paper was due), and he didn't submit feedback until about 3 days before the final paper itself was due, which is just plain unacceptable."
"Julio Borquez","5","97","2.3","100%","One main term paper, 2 mini assignments, and 2 exams. Super easy, but he talks a lot. He's so nice and truly cares for his students. He's willing to help with everything. As long as you show up to the lectures or read the assigned readings instead, you'll pass with an A."
"Devashree Dutta","2","12","3.5","25%","I really enjoyed Dr. Duttas class. I even took her for physics 2. Maybe its a personal preference but I enjoy the flexibility to teach myself the material especially since most of college has been that way. Its not hard to do well in her class. Take her!"
"Amy Wagner-Kotb","4.6","28","3","80%","Amy is an amazing professor. She is kind, respectful, and helpful. She is also reasonable with students and gives great feedback on assignments. She also, made me love marketing and think critically. She answers email quickly and alway available to help students."
"Jennifer Bauer","4.5","10","2.8","100%","Professor Bauer is very kind. She wants to see you succeed and will be there for you if you need anything! The Psych of Child Development Practicum is pretty chill: There are very few assignments which are nothing to worry about. The most crucial thing is the final (and midterm) observation by your cooperating teacher so be sure to look into those"
"Jinhua Guo","3.8","35","3.1","82%","I took 450 with him in the Winter21. He was really good. His lectures were representative of the exams and homework. Projects were fun. He is very fair and I learned A LOT. Hes probably the best Engineering Professor Ive had at UMD."
"Antonios Koumpias","3.4","18","3.6","56%","Professor Koumpias is an amazing professor. He is super caring and truly wants you to succeed. There was quite a bit of homework and his lectures were pretty dense but it was very doable. Would definitely take him again!"
"Tim Kiska","4.8","31","1.6","100%",""
"Subrata Sengupta","2.3","7","3.1","29%","Well I don't usually talk bad about professor but this class almost made me change my major and drop out of college and start working on a local small business and live on minimal wage for the rest of my life. Nothing bad with that ofc but my parents would 'unchild' me. Anyway, this professor is awful think it twice."
"Kristi Stewart","4.6","67","2.8","76%","I took her Comp class and it was really fun. However, don't fall behind on your stuff or it will kind of get overwhelming. This is a college course about writing composition so expect some long essays. But if you put in the effort and use the resources provided you will probably get a decent grade."
"Timothy Kirschenheiter","4.8","11","2.5","91%","Professor was amazing and really wants his students to pass, you get a lot of time for the assignments, and they are graded leniently."
"Kristian Stewart","4.6","13","3.5","84%","Kristi is one of the best professors in the English department, and she will teach you so much on APA. She is a kind person who cares deeply about the well-being of her students. The best tips for this class are to do assignments in advance and following the advice from "They Say, I Say". She also has a strict attendance policy, so try to show up!"
"Marilee Benore","3.4","57","3.6","54%","Absolutely goated professor. Don't listen to any of the negative reviews. She sets high grading standards and wants you to work for your grade so that you can become a good writer and develop good habits. Her experience and advice are priceless and professors like her are extremely difficult to come by."
"Hyejin Kim","4.5","25","2.8","88%","She's very good at explaining the material. Quizzes/test problems are just like the textbook problems. Doesn't take attendance (but does give extra credit based off attendance sometimes), doesn't require the textbook (just helpful to have for practice problems). Will definitely take her again given the chance."
"Kim Doohyun","N/A","","N/A","N/A",""
"Rose Wellman","5","15","2.8","100%","Such a kind woman and she clearly loves what she does. "Pop" quizzes but she usually hints at them in advance. Lots of reading tho, could definitely be a struggle if it's not a subject you're interested in, but she provided a reading guide for the novel/textbook. Very clear about her expectations and always willing to explain"
"Troy Murphy","5","23","2.5","100%","I have had this professor 3 times for different classes. He is very understanding and excepts late work with no question. His criteria is clear, and you can tell he cares about his students. His in person classes are mandatory as he has pop up assignments, but if you play your cards right you will have good timing and can tell when they will be."
"Nicholas Nalepa","4.9","16","2.3","100%","He really cares about his students. Biggest portion of ones grade will be reflected by reading the book. Most assesments are on the book not notes. This class is fair and he has a great personality."
"Jay Keeler","5","26","2.5","92%","This professor really cares about his students. Reading the pre-lab readins is crucial. Some of the lab quizzes can be difficult and so is the mid term, but he really cares and will help you with anything possible during and after his class. I highly recommend him."
"Rebecca Bieri","5","25","3","100%","A great professor. She really wants her students to succeed and doesn't sugarcoat things. There is a lot of information, but she helps you get the bigger picture and know what you really need to know for an intro class. Don't get me wrong if you don't try, you won't do well, but if you pay attention in class and study you will do fine."
"Natalie Sampson","4.9","20","2.5","100%","This is my second class with her, if I could take another with her I would. She is now of my favorite professors. She is understanding that life happens and is always open to communication. Assignments are all done online and quizzes. The oral exam sounds scary but it isn't she gives you questions, you just use the knowledge of the course. 10/10 :)"
"James Hetrick","3.9","77","4","82%","His grade scale was very generous. I learned a lot. use his office hours. 
TBH im not smart but work hard, this class hurt my other grades cus i spent so much time on this. DO probs in THE TEXTBOOK & be attent in lec.
if ur CIS major IDK if worth the time and effort esp cus class made to prep mec/elc eng and you have doubly linked list to learn."
"Nasser Beidoun","2.4","80","4.3","45%","Good professor, 3 hour lecture every week. I think he curved a little bit."
"April Wendling","3.1","4","2.8","100%","She's not too bad of a professor, just REALLY boring. It was a 2-hour and 45-minute class, which you felt every single minute. Not too much homework and about 4 exams that are all online (the class is in person). Attendance isn't mandatory but it's hard to pass the exam without it. I probably wouldn't take her again, only if I was desperate to."
"Georges Ayoub","4.4","8","3.4","88%","(Class also called ME 381) Professor Ayoub teaches the class in a way that clearly conveys the material, and he is always extremely respectful and caring towards the students. His exams actually relate to the material presented in the course and on the class assignments. You also get to use the machine shop (finally!). One of UM Dearborn's best!"
"Jie Fan","5","1","3","100%","One word- AMAZING! I absolutely loved taking anatomy (1 and 2) with this professor as he is knowledgeable in the subject and passionate when it comes to teaching it. I have never had a professor care so much for their students. He makes sure to put minimal pressure on his students and really wants everyone to do well. Best professor at UMD!"
"Lyudmila Vaysman","4.1","29","3.4","75%","."
"John Cherng","3.5","9","3.6","20%","He is very approachable, & has a deep interest in NVH & acoustics. But the course is very difficult if you lack the background knowledge. Content is from his personal experience, so there's not many resources you can use outside of class. Read his book for the quizzes, and get him to do the HW problems that don't have the solutions posted."
"Fred Feng","2.4","14","4.6","30%","The hw assignments took several hours to complete. I don't know how my peers did it since I had a background in Python & data analysis. And the group project was too much work. I lost major points on the project due to his harsh grading. Took off points for things that were not mentioned in the rubric + did not even discuss the poster in lectures."
"Jack Nelson","4.3","62","3.5","69%","Difficult to get 10/10's on labs. Does mark off points on weird things. Very nice professor and allows you to work with partners in every lab. Also, most of the time goes ahead of the lecture and does lab on things we haven't learned about but tries to explain it to us the whole way through."
"Thom Foy","4","50","2.4","72%","Don't understand any of the hype. Unless he was just fine with everyone else but me, I don't get it. I always talked and communicated to him and participated yet was a lowkey asshole. He grades these essays to harshly, I've had harder classes that graded less harshly then this 90-year-old man."
"Hung-Chung Su","3.8","9","3.5","75%","Spent too much time trying to manage my case group. Class is all about cases and there are graded case reports and presentations. The course material is never mentioned in class, it's just up to you to read the book and show up on test day ready to be tested. Seemed fair but just not how I like to learn. Do not recommend."
"Nesrin Cengiz","3.7","30","3.4","58%","Passed this class with an A. class was the lamest and boring class ever. Her classwork doesn't correspond with the homework. Her test made no sense at all. I didn't pay attention at all because of how easy it was. This class will want you to walk out of class during lectures and skip the following days of class. Don't take this course it's LAME!!!!"
"Paul Muench","5","2","4","100%","Professor Paul Muench is a real gem. Teaching is really awesome, Hardworking. Gives a lot of examples and make algorithm clear. Fun to learn data mining with professor. Must take course with this professor."
"Sonia Tiquia","2.5","42","4.4","20%","go take it in the summer or somewhere else"
"Caleb Siefert","4.3","39","2.9","89%","AMAZING PROFESSOR! Tests are straight to the point and incredibly easy as long as you do the reading questions. Very funny, engages students, and is overall a great guy. If you have the opportunity to have him as your professor, register!"
"Kathleen Pepin","3","1","2","100%","This class was interesting and an easy A, she also grades good."
"Barbara Klein","4.3","50","3","67%","Professor Klein was a great professor to have for ISM 575. Despite being a summer 2 course, professor Klein made it easy by having a clear grading criteria, clear instructions, and numerous assignments to do well in the class. Most of all, she was fair in her grading and knew how to respond efficiently to questions or comments. Good professor"
"Katherine Lacommare","3.9","55","3.8","68%","You have to show up to class because of clicker questions. Decent teacher. Friendly as a person. Had to work very hard to get an A but the best out of what will be available for 130. Sometimes doesn't give good explanations/ seems unknowledgeable. There are a lot of ways to get points but the exams are worth the bulk of the total. Enjoyed lecture!"
"Daniel Lawson","3.1","151","4.5","59%","I wouldn't say he's a great lecturer but he's not awful. He just goes really quickly through the material and mostly reads off the slides. He does a lot of in-class examples. There are many opportunities to get small amounts of points, I honestly think they helped my grade though so I'd recommend going for them."
"Yi Murphey","3","17","3.9","34%","Trick quizes."
"Lizabeth Wiggins","4.8","3","1.4","100%","Professor Wiggins is such a caring and respectful teacher. She really cares about her students. Her class is not hard, and you are given two exams and one group project. She keeps the class engaged with activities, so its not so lecture heavy. I would 100% recommend taking a class with her if you ever have the chance to."
"Junghyun Lee","3.3","9","3.5","43%","the test is harder than expected. but Professor was reasonable enough."
"Julie Felker","4.5","13","3","85%","She is so kind and the class is a breeze. I took mine online, and the whole class was about talking about your experiences and feelings. The only thing is that the exams are very hard, and she does not curve. She cares for her students though, and loves to talk if you ever need it."
"Nicholas Iannarino","4.6","19","3","100%","AMAZING PROFESSOR! He gives great feedback that helps you improve for his papers and if you show up and take notes and read the book, you're ready to go. He is funny and really cares about his students success. I am taking him again in the fall!"
"Carlos Rodriguez","3.9","46","2.9","90%","The two tests in this class are long (everyone I knew in this class ran out of time), there are lots of typos on the homework and exams, he randomly sends assignments through email, and never updates grades. You are also required to attend events on campus or in Detroit (or you'll lose points), which makes no sense since its an online only class."
"Drew Matzke","4.6","48","2.9","90%","This class was fairly essay, assignments were all discussion posts about our opinions and replying to someone else's. Tests honestly weren't too bad, go over the readings and know the basics, easy to apply the process of elimination. Curves final if the class does poorly which mine didn't need. Overall, good professor, easy A!"
"Arlo Clark-Foos","4.4","84","4.8","68%","This professor took an average of one week to respond to my emails, completely ignored one of my emails about getting additional help, and made completely harsh and inappropriate comments on assignments. The book is only needed for the first test, and after that is never needed. To say tests were hard would be an understatement."
"Bruce Maxim","4.3","48","3.6","89%","The professor was great, but be careful of the client. There is one client who raises red flags. The name of the client is Michelle Maltese, and here are the reasons:
Stinginess: She is cheap and won't pay for any tools. She expects you to either pay for them yourself or create the app from scratch the hard way."
"Timothy hartge","N/A","","N/A","N/A",""
"Rita Agius","4.3","4","2.3","100%","Such an easy class with a great professor"
"Cecilia Speyer","3","29","3.6","20%","Professor Speyer means well and is very caring but her teaching style was not effective. The book was heavily depended upon for understanding. Lab quizzes are very easy but there could be more explanation for the actual lab procedure. As I said lecture was not helpful to follow but she meant well. As for the actual exams and lecture quizzes..."
"Alan Wiggins","4.3","67","4.1","46%","He is a great prof. He does group projects but they are not graded. He goes through things nicely, the homework is not very difficult, gives extra credit and the exams are just a modified form of the homework questions. The best part is you do not need to take the finals if your grade is above 70% before the finals."
"Nisar Ahmad","5","10","2.3","100%","professor nisar is amazing in teaching one of the best professor at UM-Dearborn"
"Xiaohua Shannon Li","3.9","34","4.3","65%","She was great! Dr. Li is very straighforward with what you need to know and goes very in depth in her lectures. She assignes homework that actually helps you for the exam. Her exams can be tough, however if you did the homework and went to lecture, you were comfortable on the exams. She answers any questions and is very nice. I recommend her!"
"Lawrence Elassal","3.9","5","3.5","50%","You basically had to read the textbook for this class. 3 exams and 1 group project. Exams aren't that bad as long as u know the material. At least he's nice to look at"
"Peter Oelkers","2.8","64","4.8","30%","You'll have to do yourself his job of teaching yourself literally everything. His lectures consist of mumbles. Slides are just a few images, with no context or words. Exams are open ended, in order to ensure he gives you the grade he needs to maintain his course average. Not a good teacher in any way, but it's not like biochem majors have a choice."
"Jennifer Caitlin Finlayson","3.4","32","3.6","13%","For an English major, she is required to go through. If you are not an English major and are considering her class for whatever reason, avoid. She takes absolutely forever to grade anything. She gives 10min, 10 question quizzes and you cannot go back to a previous question. You have to memorize random vocab or info you'll never use in your life."
"Timothy A. Davis","2.9","42","3.9","30%","Horrible experience, the professor mentions that he is the "Dean of COB" almost every chance he gets. He's very unsympathetic towards the students and doesnt except late assignments under almost all circumstances. He makes a quiz every week due in the first 5 minutes of class, and being late will cost you that score."
"Rick Mueller","3.9","15","3.5","N/A","Quite good. Would take him again."
"Keshav Pokhrel","3.9","16","2.8","74%","Class was very disorganized and did not tie back to the textbook. Tests were not overly difficult, but grading was inconsistent. I asked for feedback many times through email, sometimes he would respond. Very unforgiving with grading, even though there is no late work policy in his syllabus. I had a lot of respect for him at first."
"Liz Rohan","4","61","2","88%","Prof. Rohan was a very fair professor. While her lectures were sometimes not engaging, our course content was interesting. She is very lenient with her papers. This class's grading is very final project heavy. I highly recommend using the writing lab for this class."
"Terri Laws","3.1","18","4","69%","Lots of reading. She's a really great professor, but reading and understanding are necessary. If I weren't having a personally stressful semester, I would have done better. But she worked with me, and I was excited to explain anything I was confused about. I appreciate her! Great professor! Advice: READ AND DO ALL YOUR WORK!"
"Christopher Mahr","3.5","76","2.5","80%",""
"Judy Nesmith","3.9","182","4.9","37%","By far one of the worst classes I have ever taken. this is most DEFINITELY a weeder course. The textbook is mandatory to buy to access the participation part of your grade, but we NEVER even used it. Practice problems were never provided answer keys, so you never know if your material is correct. Few tests and your grade will fully depend on them."
"Jie Shen","3.8","55","3.3","74%","One of the best professors I have had. He's understanding. His lectures are very helpful and they help a lot with the labs and assignments. His tests were a piece of cake because he tells you exactly what to study and everything he mentions is on the exams.2 exams.11 labs.4 assignments. He responds quickly and helps students during his office hrs."
"Jian Hu","3.4","6","3.5","80%","Professor Hu is a good professor. At times, it's difficult to understand him, but he's lenient when it comes to grading the exams. The 3 exams made up most of the grade, and homework barely affected it. The homework assignments did take up a lot of time. He very clearly has a lot of experience in process optimization."
"Farhad Ghoddoussi","3.5","9","2.3","67%","He was super helpful. His lectures are a bit fast-paced though, but he gives lots of practice problems from the book and goes over them in class. There's no homework though, so the grade is basically just exams and lab reports, but the exams are all MCQ, and he curves really well at the end of the course. 10/10 would recommend!"
"Ashley Whitmore","5","16","2.3","100%","Honestly one of the sweetest and most laid back professors. She gives a few readings a week to do but she's always willing to help when you're struggling, and meets one on one with students to discuss essay topics. 3 major essays, all were pretty enjoyable to write. If you need extensions, especially around finals, she's very flexible."
"Kalamesh Kumar","3.6","28","3.8","34%","Must participate in weekly discussions to get a decent grade in participation.  Very tough on grading exams."
"Jeoff Burris","1","11","4.1","0%","Class is easy until the final exam and than you are in major trouble. Three exams and no homework or project. Exams questions come from book, lectures, PPT slides, and random things added that you'll never go over. First two exams will be super easy but third one is impossible. Avoid this professor, if possible. He's just not a good teacher."
"Larry Seih","3.1","16","2.9","80%","Professor Sieh has very easy to digest lectures and a very relaxed style of teaching. The only issue I had was that his quiz questions seem subjective and hard to know exactly what he is looking for. That being said, I mostly got 100% on his quizzes and did well on the final. His labs for this course were very thorough and helped me learn a ton."
"Nehal Patel","4.4","34","3","86%","One of the best classes I have ever taken! Dr. Patel creates a fun environment while teaching and I can genuinely say that I learned a lot. I'm even considering pivoting to law because of this class alone. Super fun class with an amazing and engaging professor"
"Linxi Zhang","3.5","9","3.8","67%","Very clear lectures, good coding practice, and excellent communication. The class was not easy, but I learned a lot. She is kind and caring and always responds to emails quickly. I highly recommend her."
"Jeffrey Yackley","4","22","3.4","69%","In general, he is a very fair grader. He is working on improving his lecture style. Very understanding. Overall, good teacher. If you're interested in cyber security I would recommend."
"Christopher Pannier","2","2","3","0%","He means well, but he always gives way too much information. He also has a tendency to think that the class understands some concept after glossing over it briefly and then immediately moves on. Makes me think he doesn't really understand the material."
"Raed Almomani","3","3","3.4","67%","His enthusiasm makes me glad this was an in-person lecture. He values student involvement during lecture- ensuring that we are all on the page and understand what's going on. He has a method of gently breaking down topics into smaller pieces making it incredibly easy to learn from. 1 group project to present at the end of semester, 3 HWs, 2 Exams."
"Amy Brainer","3.5","5","2.5","60%","Super passionate and knowledgable, all about class discussions with one big project that is very practical but difficult, don't procrastinate it"
"Scott Degregorio","3.5","90","3.5","67%","Very picky with students and expects to set aside everything for his class"
"Jennifer Proctor","4.5","16","3.4","86%","So sweet and inspirational. She gives great feedback and knows that sometimes life happens and will give extra time on assignments if you're struggling. Wish she taught every film class because she is the perfect professor. Extremely knowledgeable and doesn't put you down or harshly criticize your work or act smug or conceited at all. Truly cares!"
"Bonnie Mcintosh","4.6","15","2","80%","One of the easiest classes I have ever taken! She is really nice and made the class interesting. The labs are super easy and she drops your 5 lowest lab grades. Discussions are super straightforward and she gives great feedback on them."
"Reem Barada","5","7","1.7","100%","Sweet professor who really cares about her students . I will take it again"
"Steven Scribner","3.1","14","3.6","36%","Scribner is the best. lectures are very clear and help you a lot more than just going through slides. Mechanisms are difficult in Ochem but he makes it looks so easy. provides you with so many resources. He has videos recorded by himself of how to do each mechanism. If you buy clutch prep for his course, you are wasting your money. generous grader"
"Roger Klungle","3.1","36","3.3","44%","2 take-home exams (50% each), no homeworks. Pre-recorded lectures with little face time- only during office hours every other week online. Overall easy."
"Zhiwei Xu","3","27","2.5","40%","The course is fairly simple. Aside from his explanations of the labs, his teachings did not help at all. So just focus on the lab explanations and master them as they are basically what you are tested on."
"Maggie Rathouz","4.3","20","3","72%","Professor Rathouz was definitely one of my favorites last semester. She took her time to explain, helped during office hours, and was available outside of class hours to assist with questions. Even with unprecedented circumstances I went through towards the end, she was understanding of my situation and helped me finish off the course strongly."
"Natalia Czap","3.4","20","3.5","78%","Professor Natalia Czap is an excellent teacher. Just do whatever you are asked for and you will get an easy A!"
"Anne louise Stat","2.9","17","4.4","43%","Professor wills to help but overloaded homework's, due on Wednesdays and Sundays. You need to study for this class almost 6-8 hours a week. Couldn't complete the class with my other 3 courses. It took all my time."
"Francia Martinez-Valencia","4.9","34","2","100%","Highly recommend her if you have to take Spanish. Clear grading criteria, and everything you need is supplied to you online. No textbook was required for this class. Very easy."
"Thilini Kondashinghe","4.3","21","4","75%","Best professor for orgo lab. Very clear rubric that she follows to a T, easy grader in general. Willing to work with you and genuinely cares about her students. I would highly recommend each student take classes with her."
"Nevrus Nazarko","4.3","33","3.6","66%","easy accounting. glad i took this instead of baker. He curved all the exams and dropped certain homework if enough students had an issue. I hate accounting and stopped trying midway and still did pretty good. His lecture before the exam goes over every single question so be sure to watch,"
"Linda Sorensen","5","11","2","100%","She was a good prof. Gave back feedback all time, you get one assignment a week, discussions sometimes and some tests that have some written answers and end of the year paper and a final project. It wasn't too bad if you kept up with the work and she would let you turn in something late if you talked to her before. She's very understanding."
"Tahsine Bazzi","4.3","25","2.4","80%","Not a challenging class, but his attitude/lack of tech skills are frustrating. Assumes fluency if you look Arab so he ignores my questions. Asks invasive questions like "Where are you from?". Struggles with Canvas which makes assignments/quizzes harder. Ignores emails, calls you when you text him. Consistently rude and dry tone."
"Daniel Rodriguez","3.5","2","1.5","100%","I got an A+ in this course. I'm pretty sure every one else did, too. Attendance is graded, which is the only reason you should show up for class. It seems like Prof was more invested in telling us personal stories than actually teaching us something about cyber crimes. I was very excited for this course and left disappointed."
"Kristal Reyes","3.9","4","2.1","100%","She seems like a nice person and maybe even a decent social worker, but she's probably the worst teacher I've had in my time at EMU. Consistently unorganized, correcting and building PowerPoints in the middle of lectures. Randomly didn't show up to classes. Again, lovely person, but honestly I feel like she has no business being a professor."
"Zhen Hu","2.5","4","3.5","25%","Prof Hu really cares about your success in the class, and his lecture format really prepares you for the assignments and quizzes. He does have a thick accent, but don't let that put you off. I struggled through the class, but it was down to it being a covid-online class, having a full schedule, and neglecting to watch his asynch lectures regularly."
"Jeremy Sutton","2.6","14","3.4","38%","Horrible teacher. I think all of the comments below sum up how much this guy sucks!"
"Kenneth Lipan","4.4","21","2.9","77%","I've taken HHS300 and HHS406 with him and now HHS400. This is my second rating now, he is one of the best professors at umd hands down. Don't listen to any of the bad reviews trust me TAKE HIM!"
"Claudia Kocher","4.8","31","3","77%","Great Professor! She wants you to succeed and truly cares. Prepares you very well for exams. Easy going and forgiving in grading. I wish she taught all my finance classes."
"Joseph Kirkland","5","129","2.3","99%","Loved this professor! Made his lectures very engaging and interesting!! Very easy class, one discussion and online quiz per week. Two midterms (online) and a final project. Just go to the lectures and you will feel prepared. He teaches the subject very well. He's very caring and considerate. I would definitely take him again for another class."
"Tasneem Sous","4","17","4","79%","Many webworks every week, Quiz every day Monday-Thurs. Exams are incredibly difficult. Other than that, she was a very nice teacher and explained well. The webworks were also unlimited attempts, quizzes weren't too difficult. As long as you know what you're doing and study you'll be fine. She also gives previous exams which are nice study guides."
"Margaret Willard-Traub","1.6","34","3.8","19%","Good professor"
"Robert Mann","4.4","48","3.9","72%","Barely goes over the code learned in lectures and goes through the lecture slides extremely fast. He is apparently a very tough grader but thankfully a lenient grad student graded assignments. Lab and project instructions aren't clear and very difficult. Tests will contain material that was covered for 5 minutes in class and never again mentioned."
"Annise Goodman","4","23","3.6","67%","Professor Goodman is the type of professor that goes all out for her students. Very sweet and explains really well. A tough grader but she makes it clear what she wants in the rubric. GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS! She explains really well and gives examples of what she expects. It helped boost my grade and it went from a B+ to an A"
"Robert Warren Anderson","4","34","3.3","83%","Nice professor. Class can drag a bit at times (boring lecture every now and again) but overall I found the content to be very interesting. 2 tests, a couple of podcast quizzes, 3 short papers, and an easy presentation make up your grade. Prep for the tests involve some reading so definitely go to the lecture right before for the study guide."
"Samir Rawashdeh","4.1","8","4.1","86%","This professor is not good."
"Madeleine Barkey","4.8","24","2","88%","The class was great. The homework can be difficult for beginners but she's chill and just wants to help you improve. She encourages students to view others' work to gain perspective. As long as you do what she asked on the assignments you'll get a 3/3 on each; it doesn't matter if the quality of the art isn't that great."
"Vivek Singh","3","19","4.5","43%","Absent minded professor who doesn't provide necessary tools to succeed in his class."
"Zhi kui Ling","3","2","3.5","50%","Professor is very good and well knowledgeable about the subject. The class itself is very reading and writing oriented. Overall very good and well recommended. Very interesting lectures and enjoyable."
"Pat Keyes","4.3","85","3.5","68%","I had him for BPS and that was by far the most chilling class I have ever partaken in. The students I had there were amazing and having Keyes for the second time was a delight. We barely did anything, but when we did we actually learned and he laid out what was expected for our group project very clearly."
"John Thomas","4.3","79","4.3","55%","He is really nice and actually cares for students. His exams are ok if you read the textbook, and they do challenge your thinking a bit. His class was overall great"
"Tanjore Jayaraman","4.9","12","2.1","100%","Great professor who will teach better the more students get involved. Even if the class isn't involved he does an excellent job. Quizzes are fair, and tests are curved based on the test. As long as you have a decent understanding of the material and answer all of the questions, tests are not bad. Only 2 in the semester though."
"Raji Janakiraman","2.8","3","4.5","34%","Dr. Janakiraman is a great professor! Her lectures were well organized and engaging with easy to follow slides. You need to work hard to get a good grade, and she lays out all the resources you need to do well. She welcomes questions! Her exams and quizzes were based on lectures. She is a caring professor and made the course engaging!"
"Ben Wielechowski","5","18","2.4","100%","Professor Wielechowski is a caring professor that is passionate about journalism. As long as you show up to class and participate you should be fine. If you want an extension just email him and he would be totally fine with it. Just make sure to do the weekly discussion posts that have readings because they are talked about in class."
"Ashley Whitmore","5","2","2","100%","Super fun writing and reading class. Read graphic novels, scripts, and made a podcast at the end. Tries to make discussions fun. Gives good feedback. Genuinely a nice teacher and I would take her again."
"Suzanne Bergeron","5","67","3.3","90%","I do concur with the other (positive) reviews; Dr. Bergeron is indeed an extremely nice person as well as intelligent."
"Sara Smith","4.4","12","3","84%","Dr. Smith was amazing! She has very clear guidelines that are outlined in the rubrics and help complete any assignment. Her scheduling is awesome and helps you plan around anything, there are no surprises. Would take any class with her!"
"David Chatkoff","3.4","64","4","50%","This class is consistent of 3 exams ( they are hard, average is 70 on all) and a project that has two parts. The project is an easy A, it's s the exams that you need to worry about. He doesn't want to curve/round. The class average was a B-. If you can take another professor DO IT."
"Rosciano Sulfridge","4.4","22","1.6","100%","4 speeches throughout the semester. 1 is a group speech. On the weeks prior to your speech, you have to submit an outline. Very easy class if you are willing to just speak. He is such a kind professor. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
"Ariana Angjeli","4.1","27","2.8","65%","She's ok... Has an accent so sometimes hard to understand and she doesn't want you talking in class. You just have to your homework and you should be fine. I don't think I learned anything in the class tbh. But was fairly easy to pass."
"Truman Hudson Jr.","5","7","2.9","86%","Dr. Hudson is one of those professors who leave a mark on you snd your educational journey guiding you to think constantly of transformation and reform. Encouraging us to use our voices, to stand for what is right in every aspect of a course. I am grateful my path came across such an influencing professor."
"Samantha Petrak","5","64","2.4","100%","Super funny and compassionate teacher. Only drawbacks are lots of online assignments and it's somewhat hard to reach her."
"William Birkhill","4.6","107","2","67%","The class wasn't too bad if you're good with memorization. The lectures are long, but they're worth attending; he writes pretty comprehensive notes on the board, which are really important for the exams. Never puts anything into Canvas, and grades depended on 3 exams and one optional paper."
"Carmel Price","4","29","3.3","85%","This class was one of my easiest this semester, I never had to worry because I felt Dr. Price explained everything so nicely and made sure we understood. I was scared of stats being a tough class but she made this class a piece of cake. Her exams reflect the lecture and the material perfectly and she even tells us what to know for exams. Loved her!"
"Suraj Bhamra","3.6","5","3.6","100%","straight g"
"Ya Yi","2.5","7","3.6","17%","Assignments are an easy A. Lectures don't actually help, just read the slides and the textbook. He pretends/threatens to grade for attendance but doesn't. Midterm and final aren't anything like the assignments mostly focus on the concepts covered by the book. The material was interesting, but I wish I hadn't wasted my time attending his class."
"Alan Argento","2.4","24","4.8","25%","He is the hardest professor I've taken at U of M Dearborn. He is an extremely harsh grader, doesn't curve, the labs are a tedious amount of work with vague instructions, I could go on for hours. He doesn't answer questions. He makes so many mistakes during lecture that the students have to correct him on. HW problems are NOTHING like exams. Avoid!!"
"Michael Killey","5","52","4.9","99%","the greatest teacher I have ever had in my life, given my non-accounting background, I was especially amazed at how fascinating and absorbing I found his classes and teaching, enroll in his courses now, can not recommend him enough!"
"Dan Rigato","4.3","14","2.9","86%","Midterm and final were in person. Group project was difficult, but it combines what you've learned throughout the semester. Participation matter!!!! Make sure to have good group members.  Great teacher."
"Richard Robinson","4.3","52","2.4","78%","Very flexible and relaxed class. You need to do some reading and question assignments once a week, and a discussion post. Only three exams for the semester, and as long as you do the study guide beforehand you should be perfectly fine!"

"Erik Bond","4.9","87","3.4","100%","By far the most impactful professor I have ever met. The material is amazing. The lecture delivery is unmatched. Even if you never would have thought to give much care for a specific text, he made it engaging and always made sure to draw in real life into it. Super meaningful, thoughtful, and absolute AMAZING professor! Not a single bad aspect!"
"Laura Birou","3.6","5","4.4","100%","In the fall of 2023, I had her as my professor. She's great, but her hygiene habits, like using the same hand for a handkerchief, rubber duckies, and handshakes, concern me. Despite this, she's incredibly knowledgeable, and I learned a lot from her."

"Yoon Junghee","3.8","9","2.1","100%","Professor Yoon was great! There's 4 exams throughout the course, all which are taken online and can be done anytime during the day. Lots of extra credit opportunities! You're only graded on the exams and 2 papers given during the semester, so don't procrastinate on them. (STUDY BEFORE THE EXAMS!) I would take one of her classes again."
"Ashley DaDalt","5","7","2.9","100%","Dr. Dadalt is like one of us that she was in our class WhatsApp group chat. She tries to avoid memorization, whenever possible, but sometimes the class content requires it (not her fault). Originally, I find science classes easy, but it was like there was a click in my brain when she teaches because what she says engages me and excites me to learn."

"Brian Green","3.5","63","3.8","64%","Dr Green is the best.  His communication is frequent and clear.  He is available for us multiple times a week and is great at answering questions live.  His course online is well organized, with many ways to learn (i.e. read from the book, read the modules, videos and homework). He truly cares and wants us to learn and succeed."
"Finn Bell","4","2","3.5","100%","Overall Professor Bell isn't bad, he just thinks this is the only class one may be taking. The class is based on being put into groups and partnering with organizations. There is a needs assessment, logic model, and program proposal throughout the semester. He is a very picky grader and it's impossible to get an A without dedicating 24 hours to it."
"Michael Montgomery","5","2","2","100%","He wantshis students to suceed, he extends assignments knowing we are busy with other classes. He is very good with communication. There are no exams, only two quizzes in class which he gives you a study guide identical to what you ask. It is an easy A, some assignments get lenghtly but they are more than manageable this is a hybrid course as well."
"Sang-Hwan Kim","4","6","2.8","100%","Good professor and knows the material well. The structure of the class was good, but the constant projects that sort of required meeting in person were sometimes overbearing while working a full time job."
"Helet Botha","4","4","2.8","100%","Indoctrinating students leftist ideology into the business fields. Discussing D.E.I.: critical race theory and radical gender ideology, dividing certain groups of people in the world as oppressed and oppressors. Pushing sexism narrative, women go into job fields that don't pay good is by choice, not because of gender. There's no wage gap happening."
"Young Ro","4.3","74","3","100%","Professor Ro is an amazing professor who cares about his students and provides good insights about supply chain management. I have had him as my professor since 2019, and he continues to be the best at the material, providing accommodations to all students, having flexible office hours, and numerous ways to get good grades in the course."
"Yi-Su Chen","3.5","54","4.4","72%","Worst professor I have known in my whole education experience. She is a harsh grader and non-lenient when it comes to her assignments. Despite having knowledge about certain concepts, she lacks basic teaching skills. Her assignments are worth more than the exams due to the very fact that not one student in the  
class understands what she teaches."
"Patricia Graybeal","4.1","39","4.1","96%","The first exam was a bit of a blowup for everyone in my class, but it established a rhythm for the rest of the class. There are a lot of real-life connections made in the course showing that these skills can be implemented outside the classroom."
"Hei-Wai Lee","2.4","48","4.9","36%","Professor Lee certainly assigns a lot of reading, but if you put in the work, you will do well."
"Diana Smrt","2.5","137","4.4","22%","Prof Smrt is hands down the best professor I had for creating engaging lectures and activities, definitely not rude like people make her out to be. That being said, be aware that her class is very challenging at times, expect C-E test class averages and very stressful simulation assignments. Still she is a sweet professor who is willing to help."
"Taehyun Shim","2.8","9","4.4","0%","Online class. Lectures are too much & hard to go thru. Prof. knows his stuff but its very hard to understand him / digest the course content. If you are currently working, expect to only get a hold of him during his office hours (1 hr/week). Exams are crazy hard & not even close to the homework. He is a nice guy but, don't take his classes."
"Anna Muller","4.5","38","2.9","100%","Great! Super understanding and always willing to help. The readings are exhausting, but she helped in finding a better understanding of the works we read."
"Lara Rusch","3.1","21","3.1","43%","She is a joke. Barely grades anything until the last week of the semester so you have no idea if you're doing good or not. My grade dropped from an A to a B- within a day because of this. Makes you do 15 hours of volunteer work for no reason. Quizzes every week. Grades the final paper incredibly harsh, and doesn't give ANY feedback at all."
"Ryan Pacheco","4.6","34","3.1","88%","I took ASTR 133 online and it was such a disaster. Took forever to grade anything and the assignments made no sense we didn't learn anything at all. Such a disappointment seriously the class was so insanely stressful, miserable, and so difficult for an intro course. Acted like we were rocket scientists that already knew everything."
"William Hatley","2.6","7","2.9","50%","This professor is good at his job, but this is a very lecture-heavy class. He often gives his personal political opinions in class which I feel can be annoying. But my favorite thing about him is that he grades very quickly, most professors don't do that. Overall, he's a decent professor."
"Lina Jawad","4.1","19","2.3","84%","She was pretty easy. Had a discussion post weekly and sometimes an "exam" that was only 20 questions. Was really bad at responding to emails and never replied to me once. Also make sure to turn in everything on time since she's strict about deadlines. Pretty easy prof overall"
"Ghada Saad","3.9","92","3.6","75%","Just don't, If  you go to U of M you know these type of teachers, ahh the entire class did bad, must be not my probleem and all these students are just complacent.- this is a standard clac class should not be this difficult, Im almost approaching senior year and will be retaking this class, all my other classes A and B, 20 percent of grade everyexm"
"Hugo Casquero","5","1","3","100%","He's what I'd want out of any professor at this school. He doesn't leave you stuck only "understanding" theory, but not application. While you're not coming out of his class an expert in CFD by any means, how he teaches makes it practical for you to go on to other courses or do research on your own time in this field of study."
"Darya Howell","4","1","2","100%","(Inperson) Professor Howell is an amazing professor once you get to meet her! shes a little akward at first, just communicate with her. She gives students extra help on labs to perfect their score and cares about students. Do be on time to lab, ASK questions if you need & always email her if you need more help outside of class she always responds."
"Areen Alsaid","4","1","2","100%","Pretty chill professor, not bad at all. She's decent at explaining material, but could get confused or have a typo in the slides sometimes. Homework was just textbook problems, not bad. Exams were noncumulative and one formula sheet allowed, very fair. Don't miss any lectures though, as she assigns easy groupwork that counts as a quiz grade."
"Feng Xu","4.4","4","3.3","100%","Lectures are long and excessive, However, the content is very simple and straight forward. Grades are usually from quizzes, exams and extra credit. Don't mess up on the quizzes and you'll be good."

"Eyad Hailat","2","1","4","N/A","I wouldnt. Lectures arent great, contents not great, the class is just not very great! 2 group projects, second one builds off first. 2 exams, both timed and kinda hard. 4 HW assignments that can be difficult. Syllabus had extra credit listed, then he decided to change it, THEN decided to change it back last minute. Sorta disorganized?"
"Adam Sekuler","5","1","3","100%","Bring this man chai latte with oat milk, he will love you forever. Adam is a great professor if you are interested in production. He is understanding and listens to feedbacks, has amazing jokes and bad puns. Take him if you want more hands on learning style of production media."
"Kyongson Park","1","10","5","0%","Mrs. Park likes to throw unnecessary assignments weekly. These assignments are not beneficial. I can't use any of these assignments with my students. She gives too much work. My friend took the same class with another professor that didn't give them that much work. I would never sign up for any of her classes again. She's stressing us out!"
"Michelle Beddow","4.5","6","1.9","100%","GO TO CLASS, there is absolutely no way for you to get a good grade by skipping any classes. Her lectures are very straightforward but we got so behind so just manage your time well and study."
"Ben Phillips","3.6","64","4","62%","He does not give much feedback unless you ask something in person. It is very difficult to get a good grade. He sets high expectations."

"Jill Darling","1","3","4","0%","If I dont agree with her politicak views, my grade is affected"
"Patrick Beauchesne","2.6","20","3.6","45%","He's a great guy who cares deeply about his students. Takes the time to get to know everyone personally, and makes it clear you can come to him even with non-class-related issues. Don't take his class if you don't want to have to participate, and definitely not if you don't like writing."
"Jean-Carlos Polanco Lopez","4.6","62","3.5","78%","Cool concept, easy class. It's like getting free therapy!"
"Georgina Hickey","3.2","46","3.8","24%","Very tough professor I don't really recommend. Her grading criteria is almost never ever straightforward and in general just doesn't make sense."
"Christine Fischer","4.5","23","3","91%","Class is fine and not hard at all, but she is impossible to impress. She never gives 100% on anything or for anyone. She is nice but that grading problem of hers will become intolerable by the end of the semester.  Warning: your work will never be "concise" enough for her."
"Jonathan Kantor","4.9","37","2","100%","Professor Kantor is AWESOME!! He was very flexible with me! I work and go to school full-time so it really helped me to succeed! He is willing to work with you if life happens to come up! I'm taking him again for Spanish 102 next semester!"
"Dale Igram","3","1","4","N/A","He has the potential to be good but hasn't gotten there yet. Lectures are very boring and exams are difficult (also, grades aren't posted in Canvas). I don't think he's bad, and it couldn't hurt to give him a chance, he just needs some work. Homework is straight from the book with numbers slightly changed."
"Terra Mauer","5","1","2","100%","I don't usually leave ratings for professors unless I feel as if they truly deserve it. Dr. Mauer is genuinely one of the sweetest professors at UMD. She cares about us as students and genuinely wants to see us succeed. She's always laughing and doesn't make this subject more complicated than needed. 100000% recommend taking Micro with her."
"Khalid Kattan","5","10","2.9","100%","Excellent professor, though need to be regular and consistent but overall a must take"
"Eric Ratts","2.7","59","4.4","30%","Ratts says he wants us to do well but won't give material to do so. First week he literally whined "his notes are his notes, don't talk to the dean like others have." Notes go too fast, tests are harder than examples. Curves are crazy. If it weren't for the unannounced curve a day before grades were due, more than half the class would have failed."
"Wayne Fu","2.6","14","3.6","36%","One of the best professors. He is very nice professor. His homework can be hard but most of them are very easy, my advise is to  pay attention to him and take notes in this lectures and you will be fine in his class. I highly recommend him. I was very unsure to take him at fist because of all the negative feedbacks but he's totally the opposite."
"Ali Bazzi","3.5","29","3.3","72%","I personally did not enjoy the lectures that much. I felt like they had no structure to them. I did the learning mostly on my own. I am giving a 3 because he is a nice guy who appreciates questions and because I ended up with an A in the class."
"Youssef Mosallam","3","2","1","50%","Probably one of the best professors I had in my whole college experience."
"Ali Hassan","5","1","3","100%","Professor Hassan was accommodating during the lab; he was down to assist us whenever needed."
"Thomas Fiore","4.6","43","3.3","95%","No final exam, instead there's a group project you work on throughout the semester and then present at the end. Graded by your individual part, so you can do well even if your teammates don't contribute. Allows up to four sheets (8 sheets front and back) of notes during midterms. Textbook is free online."
"Susan Baker","3.9","147","3.8","56%","The class was fast-paced and lecture-heavy. She packs a lot of material into one semester, expect to finish a chapter per class. Quizzes on every chapter once a week, as well as around 3-6 homework assignments each week. Professor Baker is very knowledgeable about accounting but can make students feel lesser for not understanding beginner concepts."
"Susan Erickson","3.6","48","3.9","59%","Voice is soothing. Long lectures. Somewhat tough grading. Lots of weekly readings."
"Alicia Schaeffer","4.4","22","2.6","91%","She's a great professor and will remember each and every student. She has a passion for what she does, but she can get a bit tough on grading. There are two essays throughout the semester and a lot of in-class assignments. As far as essays, she is REALLY picky and tough. Overall, she's very chill and I wouldn't mind taking her again."
"Christopher Alteri","5","16","2.8","100%","Greatest of all time. If I would have put in just a little more effort, easy A."
"Susan Gavell","4.6","11","2","91%","Take this professor you won't regret it!! She really is the best. Many extra credit oppourtunites. Essays are good and gave a good amount of time to complete, and is willing to work with you if ur unable to complete an assignment by the due date given. Has certain grammar points to work on for essays. If you focus in this class ur good. I loved her"
"Yan Xie","2.7","17","3.4","43%","Avoid her at all costs. The lectures are very bland and boring. Truly the worst prof I've had in all my years as a student. UMD should not allow someone like her to teach. Super stubborn and her grader is extremely tough even though it's supposed to be based on completion. She's too lazy to do anything about it though."
"Raji Janakiraman","3.8","48","3.9","78%","Dr. Raji is a professor worth taking, especially if you major in some type of biology. While Dr. Raji may be a bit of a tough grader, she is truly worth it to take as the material she teaches, especially how she teaches it, will make sure you understand the fundamentals of biology, which will help you with the rest of your biology classes"
"Patricia Hartshorn","4.2","66","2.9","100%","Prof Hartshorn is very flexible and will assist you thoroughly through assignment questions if you need help. I had her for an online course which included a lab and I liked it. I am very bad at science, but we got to work in groups and submit assignments together every week. The final was a reflection paper, midterm was MC - moderately hard."
"Vera Flaig","4","53","2.5","60%","For a general ed class it's a lot of extra work for no reason. Not that difficult though but sooo many lecture videos."
"Paul Watta","3","168","3.9","63%","Uses OpenFrameworks GFX to teach an "Engineering" C/C++ programming course. Egregiously, he determined whose final project proposals to approve based on indivdl. student quiz grades. This meant students failing the class only had to write a set of functions and those who worked hard to achieve a high grade had to write 500+ line programs. Fair?"
"Scott Macek","5","12","2.3","100%","This is the best professor I've ever had. He genuinely cares about his students. His background in the FBI makes this class very exciting, and we got to go over relevant issues. Since my major is Cybersecurity, this was a required class -- and he thoroughly goes over job opportunities for Cybersecurity in federal agencies. TAKE HIM!"
"Jason Sprague","3.9","12","2.6","84%","There is a weekly assignment and you have to show up to class, that's pretty much it. His lectures are great and won't bore you out 99% of the time. There are a few weeks where there is a larger paper/assignment and those may take like 5-6 hrs. The Final paper is a bit long but he grades very fairly and this class was overall easy and worth taking."
"David Sobiechowski","3.6","86","3.1","72%","I literally never paid attention in class, but I still got an A by doing all the quizzes online and the learning curves. The tests were not bad. I suggest reading the chapters, going over learning curves, then doing the REVIEW QUESTIONS. also the day before exam, write down what he says is going to be on the test. best guideline I had."
"Stanley Weed","4.1","84","2.7","91%","His online course had a lot of well put together presentations. He would speak for about one hour in the prerecordings, and you just followed along. Take notes on everything you remember and talk about the material on his exams. Each of them are an essay, and they can be quite large. Apart from that, there's a short research essay and 2 short hw's!"
"Carol Mei","2.5","29","4.1","37%","Absolutely the worst professor at UoM Dearborn. Her lectures are pointless and do not mirror the exam questions. She expects her students to memorize all applicable equations for each exam. She is deceivingly nice in person but makes no effort to help students succeed. Zero teaching skills."
"Sheila Smith","2.6","176","3.9","8%","Believe me or not . This professor is the best at UMD . Her way of teaching is amazing .she will curve the exam with 50 points off . You can lose 50 points . Simply take her . You learn a lot and you will love her"
"Adrion Dula","3","3","3.4","100%","Dula's lectures were not my favorite. She is often on her phone during class and is not paying attention and correcting students when they are discussing in French amongst themselves. She also refused to accommodate a classmate who had gotten covid during the semester, leaving them to miss out on valuable learning while they were sick."
"Abass Al-Haj Ahmad","5","2","2","100%","One of the best physics professors at this school. I would definitely take another class with him and I highly recommend him."
"Mohammad Harati","3.6","13","3","84%","Great professor, really nice and cares about students. He is understanding. Just make sure to read over everything before pre-lab quizzes."
"Richard Frost","2.6","5","3.9","100%","pros:
-drops your lowest lab and quiz grade
-lots of industry experience
-friendly and good sense of humor
-attendance isn't mandatory
cons:
-awkward lecturer
-inaccessible outside of class (never really responds to email)

graded on a lab (almost) every week, zybooks (basically reading/participation), two quizzes, two exams. no actual hw otherwise"
"Kas Kasravi","4.1","28","3.1","82%","Prof Kas made it clear that he was there to help students succeed in their engineering studies and future careers. He made himself available to answer questions and was always quick to respond to emails. He didn't drill material without a detailed explanation of how it would apply in the "real world." Excellent teacher and mentor."
"Katherine Majeske","3.5","41","3","75%","She is very hard to get a response back from when you have a question on an assignment and takes forever to grade things. She is extremely passive aggressive in all of her responses, whether it is a comment on assignments, or email responses. Also, be prepared to have the most group work you've had for an online class."
"Ta-Wei Kao","2.1","16","3.8","40%","He doesn't have the slightest idea about what he is teaching and on top of that he grades assignments and exams harshly. The questions he gives in the exams do not match with the material he teaches in class. The worst professor to teach such a major course of supply chain i.e, Logistics."
"Ogie Stewart","4.1","138","3.5","80%","Very easy to get along with and a great teacher. Chemistry is very "teach it yourself" but Professor Stewart is willing to help you given you don't understand the material in a more friendly way than other profs. Her exams are straightforward given you review the slides and mastering chem correctly"
"Edythe Sonntag","2.5","79","5","30%","Run away. Worst professor ever, puts 150 things on reviews but only 20 things on the exam. Does not know how to grade, shows up late, does not care about you or if you are learning. Exams are like 90 percent of your grade which she gatekeeps until the last day of the semester. Extremely unprofessional and blames her shortcomings on her other job."
"Nikolay Lavrov","4.1","71","3.3","87%","He is very helpful and lenient. GO TO OFFICE HOURS. He allows retakes on pretty much everything for up to full credit and will help you. As long as you show effort he will be helpful and courteous. He likes to tell russian jokes and is funny. He has a russian accent but it is very understandable and you will get used to it right away."
"Krisanu Bandyopadhyay","4.3","95","2.6","82%","AMAZING PROFESSOR AND HUMAN BEING. If you are lucky enough to have him as a professor, register! Makes lectures fun and helps students who want to succeed."
"Imran Aijaz","4.1","43","2.4","81%","great guy, amazing professor, not too tough of a grader, just pay attention and participate in class"
"Bushra Hussain","3","10","4.3","100%","If you cannot prioritize this class and spend time on it, do not take her. Her lecture is not good enough to give you a good score on the exam. She also always made mistakes with due dates, she would make quizzes due the day before it was supposed to be due, and almost never answers emails."
"Armagan Bayram","4","8","3.1","75%","Dr. Bayram was an excellent teacher especially since I took the course online asynchronously. Her videos were pretty thorough and covered a good amount of both new material and examples. Be sure to actually do the homework assigned otherwise you'll end up confused. Engineering statistics is difficult so it's not an easy course, but Dr. Bayram helps"
"Mark Lane","5","15","1.8","100%","Literally best professor ever. He's so funny and is superrrr understanding. Very chill person and recommend taking if you have to take comp 105. Gave me 100 on everything."
"Amy Brainer","4.5","42","3.3","85%","Second time taking her and I wish I could have her for every class! Assignments were done on Perusall, which was a great way to collaborate outside of traditional discussion boards. Lectures were amazing and she was receptive to varying opinions. TAKE HER!!!"
"Ahmet Tuncez","4.4","30","3.3","90%","Does a good job making difficult concepts understandable. Great professor."
"Sana Neji","3.2","44","1.6","75%","It was a great course overall"
"Ian Kennedy","4.8","39","1.8","98%","Too many essays to write and he assigns too many homeworks"
"Vaman Naik","3.2","28","3.8","67%","The exams are tough to be honest, but just make sure you truly understand his lectures. He is always ready to help, and I can feel his passion towards physics when he was explaining the concepts! Explain the materials clearly and in depth"
"Anys Bacha","4.8","17","3","100%","Exams are worth a lot and are hard. Lucky you also gets to present a project of code in Python, in a C++ course. Attendance is mandatory as he does random pop quizzes which are also difficult. LOTS of lecturing, and upon those gives us extra hours of videos to watch at home."
"Kevin Kobelsky","2.9","64","4.8","39%","he knows he is a failure as a teacher, just sit through his class, and make sure you get average scores in assignments, there is a huge curve at the end of the class. by the end of the class you will not have learned anything so don't try! and be prepared for him to be rude and bully you around about how he knows everything and you don't."
"Krim Lacey","2.3","22","4.1","54%","No rubrics for assignments. Even if u did the work right, he will take off points for no reason. Very disrespectful, told a hijabi girl to remove her hood during class. Hes the only teacher that teaches it, so your just gonna have to deal with it. Just be prepared for mental breakdowns and the points deducted for simple math."
"Joan Remski","3.4","78","3.6","71%","Had her for Linear Algebra during a covid semester, the textbook is free and the homework is optional. She gives you the BEST videos: amazing quality, easy to understand, only as long as they need to be, in addition to the class lectures. There were more short video quizzes earlier in the year, they were helpful, but impacted my grade negatively :)"
"Kent Murray","3.7","30","3.4","88%","Good professor. Although attendance isn't mandatory, you have these mini quizzes each lecture in Top Hat (app). Exams are okay, if you do the homework and reading you should be fine. Final exam is comprehensive."
"Charu Chandra","1","18","4.6","0%","One of the word professors you encounter, he schedules exams of an online asynchronous on other courses date and isn't flexible with time.

He's aggressive in his emails and responses, I would never take a course with him again even if he was offering free grades."
"Mahmoud Abou-Nasr","4.7","18","2.1","89%","Most of the class is him lecturing. The assignments are few and far between, and he's very willing to help if you reach out to him. Class is an easy A if you put in some effort, he's very understanding of late work and helpful too. Overall a nice professor to have."
"Jirjees  Matti","5","5","2.1","100%","Professor Jirjees Matti is an exceptional professor who cares about the success of the student. Just put in the work, do the assignments and group projects and you will be fine. No exams in the class."
"Wael Hassanieh","N/A","","N/A","N/A",""
"DeLean Tolbert","1.6","28","2.4","18%","She deserves better ratings. I learned so much in her class. She gives you so many opportunities for extra credit it's almost impossible to not get an A. The labs are a lot of fun and the TAs are extremely helpful. You don't really see Dr. Smith a lot during the semester but she provides you with great material and is super nice."
"Brian McKenna","4.6","128","2.3","96%","Hands down my fav professor. I wouldn't consider the class workload heavy but you need to do A LOT of reading. There were 4 assignments, 3 discussions, 3 quizzes, & 2 exams. You couldn't mess up on the assignments or discussions as long as you followed the rubric and answered the questions. Does not accept late work so turn in everything on time."
"Rachel Misfud","2.8","14","3","50%","Trick questions on quizzes, hand drawn diagrams of cells you have to somehow label yourself, all-credit or no-credit papers, and you "might" get a study guide. A 100 level course that is my worst grade and not even related to my major. 2 BIO majors tutored me and couldn't make sense of her material. Take someone else, I wish I would've."
"Lee Freeman","2.9","29","3.5","63%","Just do not take him. Especially in summer. The amount of work and time you have to devote to this class is insane. Mind you you are working on weekly group assignments that build in difficulty and need for collaboration. I am lucky to have only taken one summer course so that I had the time for this one."
"Dorina Hoxhaj","N/A","","N/A","N/A",""
"Vince Nguyen","5","2","1","100%","Funnest Class ever, I look forward for this Lab every week with Vince."
"Anne-Louise Statt","2.4","91","4.1","33%","If you have to take this class with her, do not take any other classes at the same time. Tons of time consuming hw w/ multiple attempts allowed. Does not effectively teach the material. She is disrespectful to students. Ask 1 question & you have more questions or she won't properly answer your question. Midterm will greatly affect your final grade."
"Ashley Walicki","5","1","2","100%","Professor Walicki is AMAZING! She is such a sweetheart and very knowledgeable in her field of study. Her class wasn't that bad at all, very straightforward of expectations and what not. She is so chill, she cares about her students and wants everyone to succeed at the end of the day. Don't worry or hesitate taking her :)"
"Carol Hogan","4","109","3","66%","She words her exams/quizzes in very strange ways and makes it extremely easy to get a question wrong although you know the answer, but it was worded weirdly."
"Jeniffer Capers","5","4","1.6","100%","I loved Professor Capers! Her lectures were always super interesting and they always told you what you needed to know for the exam. The study guides were very helpful since sometimes the exact same questions would be on the exam. Attendance isn't required, but it definitely helps, especially since there were extra credit opportunities in class."
"Tony Simari","3.5","47","3","46%","Just do the PowerPoints. There were 8 quizzes and 3 exams."
"Ivy Forsythe-Brown","3.3","41","3","40%","Professor Forsythe-Brown is a great professor who is hilarious during class. She genuinely wants the best for her students, and wants us to succeed. We have a few group papers to do across the semester, as well as 3 exams. She is great at extending deadlines if we are busy and understands that we have a lot going on in our lives. One of the best"
"Sam Hallman","4.5","28","3.1","80%","Dr. Hallman is very humble.
Tips to secure an A:
ACE all the homework! Open lectures while working on HW, cross-verify hand calculations with SPSS, and submit when aligned.
For tests. Begin with SPSS calculations, then use Excel for part of the by-hand calculations, then proceed with the calculations. Maintain open communication with Dr. Hallman!"
"Kiumi Akingbehin","2.4","60","3","10%","Decrepit lecturer with null knowledges and tough grading the same exam from 2020. Awful."
"Michael Meade","2.3","65","3.8","20%","Slow grader, wastes hours of the lecture going over basic material then rushes through the challenging topics in the last 30 minutes. Terribly boring lectures, taking this class was like hitting my head against a brick wall for 1 hour 45 minutes twice a week."
"Eric Charnesky","4","16","2.8","100%","The professor is a chill guy, but you won't learn a lot in class as he goes through the material quickly. the projects make up 70% of your final grade, but he grades them very leniently. the rest are mid-sem exam (an open-book online test), labs and zybooks which again are very easy."
"John Baugh","5","73","2","100%","Web tech is a must for CIS majors. This course was online, covers the latest frameworks and has projects that will get you up to speed to be able to make professional websites. He covers the basics, HTML, CSS, JS and then you learn about PHP, Node, React, MySQL and cloud databases such as MongoDB. Highly recommend this class."
"Samia Al-Qaisi","2.4","157","4.3","31%","Avoid at all costs, very rude an unprofessional.  Treats the students like they are in middle school, not as adults paying to be there.  Condescending at every opportunity that she gets.  Be prepared for her to be delusionally paranoid during tests as well."
"Jamal Kassir","2.8","3","3.4","100%","At times went very fast on things that needed more time. Assumed students knew things he knew. Tests are very difficult. Overall it always felt like too much was going on but we kept doing more and more."
"Jing Kong","3","2","3.5","100%","Previous reviewer stated that there was a curve. There was no curve for the final. The final was nothing like the practice exam. It was difficult and should have been graded on a curve. She is not a consistent grader and favors certain students if she curved one student's grade and not the other."

"Pamela Todoroff","2.5","28","4.3","56%","Todoroff was easily the worst writing teacher I ever had. Spent the first hour of each session complaining about how incompetent her class supposedly was. Despite what she said in class, the class featured busy work almost exclusively. Thankfully, feedback was provided on each assignment such as "??" and "What were you thinking?" Very insightful."
"Steven Morrow","4.8","3","2.4","100%","Mr. Morrow is by far one of the best Professors I have ever taken. From leniency in regard to homework assignments to allocating an abundant amount of time to office hours.  For me at least he explain the course in a clear manner, although at times it was unstructured.  I wish he had stayed at U of M for more time to take more of his classes."
"Pauline Vinson","1","1","5","N/A","doing everybody a favor and warning you. DO NOT TAKE HER!!!! she thinks we're professional authors and expects the most"

"Tobin  Dykstra","5","2","1","100%","1 quiz + 1 discussion per week, and exams are open note (no surprise assignments). Everything you need to know for the exams is in the lecture/slides. I wish Dr. Tobin taught more classes, I would take every class he teaches!! This class is an easy A and you learn a lot!!! You won't regret taking ANY class with Dr. Tobin."

"Elif Izberk-Bilgin","2.6","49","3.7","29%","She's very caring but a bit strict & loose on instructions. Doesn't give rubrics for group projects. Expects quality work & lots of critical thinking. No curves but gave my class extra points on final exam b/c most of us got the same couple of questions wrong. Felt confident on tests but most of the class did not do well w/ averages just over 50%."
"Matthew Heinicke","4.1","38","3.1","81%","Had him for evolution/pop genetics. Lectures were incredibly boring, but the material was interesting. Exams were as straight forward as they come. Do the practice exam, read (even skim) the chapters (won't take more than 3.5 hours if thorough), check over the slides---you'll do great. There was a group presentation, and his grading was forgiving."
"Tawfiq Khalil","5","1","4","100%","He did a nice job in the lectures and made difficult topics easy to understand. He is clear with his communication and fair in grading. Very respectful and supportive to students."
"Pamela McAuslan","4","55","3","80%","I found her lecture style really annoying so it was hard to sit in class. she's not clear on her requirements and then grades down."
"Michael McCarthy","3.9","33","2.9","72%","Amazing professor. His class was so easy to understand, he recorded his lectures and posted them, and is was so fun. He is caring, but he is also fair to all students, so he will not allow excuses unless it is valid. His exams are always based on his lectures and homework. One of the best professors I've ever taken."
"Crystal Scott","3.8","25","2.8","91%","This professor will give you the worst exams you have ever taken, and make it worth 40% of your grade. The whole class will be a breeze until you take those two exams, which my class averaged 65% with no curves. She is also condescending; she does not like answering the same question twice."
"Kelly Ann Jabbusch","3.8","73","3.1","91%","She is a sweet lady but a tough grader. I had to take calc 1 again after this class. She is a decent teacher but with all the time the webwork takes you it should account for more of your grade. Exams were on class material but it felt like she gave the harder ones. Doing better with a different teacher now"
"Hussein Nasralah","4.6","24","3.5","100%","One of the best professors on campus. Dr. Nasralah set up multiple study sessions outside of class before the exam. He also brought snacks for us! Amazing teaching style, would take again for sure."

"Hana Pan","5","1","2","100%","Most of grade is from the group project and exams. Not a tough grader. Provides feedback on all submitted assignments."
