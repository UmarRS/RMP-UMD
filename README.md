# RMP-UMD

This is a rate my professor web extension for integration within the University of Michigan - Dearborn's proprietary scheduling website.

The teachers database is stored locally inside the background script, as the db is small enough (with no sensitive info) to where no hosting is neccessary.

How to use this extension:

Step 1: Install from the chrome web store or load the extension file unpacked, see step 1a (auto updates not supported with unpacked extensions, and generally not recommended.)

Link to extension: (placeholder)

Step 2: Visit the "registration & schedule" page for UM-Dearborn students

Step 3: Click into the "browse classes" page

Step 4: View a term which has had the classes' professor info released (ie has professor next to class name) (we do not control when this appears)

Step 5: Search for a subject/class

Step 6: Click on the UM logo next to a professors name to see their RMP info
